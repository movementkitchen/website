Research shows that musculoskeletal pain, urinary incontinence, abdominal separation (Blyholder et al., 2016) and pelvic organ prolapse are as a matter of fact common amongst postnatal runners. But *just because something is common, it doesn’t mean that it’s normal* — writes Emma Brockwell, a Women’s Health Physiotherapist. This March, Emma teamed with two more UK based physios to publish [Returning to Running Postnatal — Guidelines for medical, health and fitness professionals](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335928424_Returning_to_running_postnatal_-_guidelines_for_medical_health_and_fitness_professionals_managing_this_population#fullTextFileContent) who support running mums.

> So, what is that we need to know about running?

### Subtitle

Using the learning from clinical practice and research in the field of women's health, Brockwell's team is challenging the currently accepted 6/8 weeks timeframe for going back to vigorous exercise after the baby. Instead, they suggest a gradual return to physical activity, increasing impact and intensity with time. Running is a high impact activity, so it would be resumed 3–6 months following the childbirth.
