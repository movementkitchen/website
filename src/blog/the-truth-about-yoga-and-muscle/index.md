As both a sports scientist and long-time yoga practitioner, I often get asked if yoga alone is enough for building strength.

The short answer is yes and no.

Yoga is not just about stretching and flexibility. Oh, yes, you do use muscles, as anyone who has ever done chaturangas, cranes and other arm balances will know very well. But, yoga can build mostly one type of muscle fibers and it's not very effective for gaining muscle mass.

Now, let me explain. The muscles that move and support our bodies have two types of muscle fibers:

- **Slow-twitch, aka your endurance muscles** – They create little force but can work for a long time without getting tired
- **Fast-twitch aka your power and speed muscles** – They contract quickly and produce more force but tire more quickly

Most of our muscles have both types of fibers weaved in, more or less, depending on genetics and the type of training you do.

Yoga involves mostly isometric (muscles stay the same length) and eccentric contractions (muscles lengthen while firing) and holding positions. We use muscles to keep the body together, resist the gravity and hold the weight of the body at more or less challenging angles. And this particular input builds endurance fibers - so you get better at staying in those positions for longer.

But, there is usually not enough input to build the power and strength fibers. Maybe a bit, in the power-style yoga sequences that include some jumping, dynamic transitions and explosive movements. But, even then, without adding weights and resistance the gains will not be enough for you to visibly gain muscle mass.

## Which fibers are better?

Well, you want to have both. Slow-twitch fibers are better at using oxygen and nutrients and have higher insulin sensitivity. But we need the power and speed muscles, especially as we age, to prevent falls, keep independence and maintain strong bones. Also, guess which of the two types we lose the most with ageing? The power ones.

## Progressive Overload is Key

To build muscle, we need progressive overload. In other words, we need to challenge that muscle to gradually handle more and more loading by getting bigger and stronger.

The endurance fibers build more strength as we gradually increase time under tension, let's say by holding yoga poses longer. So, that one is fine. But the power and speed muscles grow by being challenged to produce a more powerful muscle contraction in a shorter time. Let's be honest, yoga is not going to cut it there.

But, yoga works beautifully when combined with some resistance and weight training 2-3 x a week.

This frequency:
- Is strong enough stimulus for muscle growth
- Leaves you enough time for recovery between sessions
- Can be squeezed into most people's schedules
- Pairs well with the daily feel-good yoga

## The Pushing vs Pulling Problem

Another tricky bit about yoga asanas, as a fixed system of positions, is that we have a lot of pushing movements but hardly any pulling.

Why does that matter?

To keep our shoulders healthy, we need a good balance of pulling and pushing. But in yoga, we have downward dogs, planks, chaturangas (again) and many other pushing movements but no pulling at all.

This creates a lot of stress on the muscles at the front of the shoulder, while weakening the back and the small muscles inside that rotate and stabilise the shoulder joint. So, adding resistance training you want to include plenty of pulling movements to complement your yoga practice.

Here is a Youtube playlist with some pulling exercises to get you started: [Strength Training for Yogis - Pulling Movements](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZHZ9FJ8TtH2eZXxLZyTPSN-Uqk9S9Dq)

## In a Nutshell

Yoga does build muscle, but it's the endurance fibers we get, not the power ones. For extra power and strength, especially in midlife and onwards, we need to add resistance/weights training minimum 2 x a week to build and maintain muscle mass, bone density and functional strength as we age.

When designing your resistance/strength training, make sure to include some pulling movements, as we are missing those in yoga. We need both pushing and pulling for shoulder stability and long-term health.

## Couple of things for the end...

If you have been thinking about starting coaching, now is a good time. Until the end of the month, whoever signs up for coaching gets a free set of 5 mini resistance bands to get you started building strength. Drop me a line if you are interested.

Also, from this month onward, I will be creating an upbeat workout playlist to inspire you each month. Here is the [first one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/your-playlist-link) combining some warm, bassy Detroit house and a bit of dark underground UK club sound. Check it out and let me know what you think.

Have a great weekend,

### What some of my clients say:

> "Ivana has been a beam of hope for me. I was really considering surgery. I'm so glad that I found her because through her coaching I have learnt so much about the feet and their connections through the legs and pelvic floor. Everything aligns. I've noticed such an improvement that I don't have to buy tops which are a size bigger to fit my belly. I also feel stronger and reconnected to my core, now I know how it works and my awareness is better."

> "I am motivated because I feel improvement. My life has changed. Now nothing feels bothersome, I have energy and will power because finally, after 10 years, I have no pain! Thank you very much!" - translated from the original: "Motivisana sam jer osećam boljitak. Promenio mi se život. Sad me više ništa ne mrzi, imam energije i volje jer konačno posle 10 godina nemam bolove! Mnogo ti hvala! ❤️"

> "It's been amazing working with Ivana. During the last couple of years I've learnt so much and have seen my strength and coordination steadily improve. Every summer I take my kids to aqua-bounce and have been impressed by how noticeably my ability to manoeuvre the water obstacle course progresses with each year."
