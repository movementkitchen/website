Trying to solve a puzzle of my postnatal re-injuries, I found myself digging into mechanisms of injuries until I ended up at a master’s degree programme in sports biomechanics. Even after a decade of working with pregnant and postnatal women, completing numerous short courses and learning on my own body, I always thought there was something out there I still didn’t know and if I only understood that one more piece, I’d figure out why things never felt the same after I had the babies. 

Which things? - you might ask. In my case, it was the integrity of my midsection. I felt like my abdomen would fall apart and my organs would spill out when I lift something heavy. I wanted to figure out why my body struggled with regulating the intra-abdominal pressure; why, even 7-years after my last pregnancy and birth, I kept getting re-injured and regressing to the postnatal level of fitness following every bout of intense exercise that was meant to challenge my core. I was worried that my lack of abdominal integrity could with time get worse and possibly cause other problems, such as pelvic organ prolapse. I had no answers – I felt stuck.

But the sport science offered me few solutions. I had expected that the childbirth, as the most challenging athletic endeavour of a woman’s lifetime, should include a recovery similar to rehab from sports injuries. But there were hardly any evidence-based guidelines for female athletes who wanted to continue to train while pregnant and return to sport after having a baby. 

The sport science seemed barely interested in studying women, even before postnatal injuries and related disorders. I was shocked to find out that [only 4 - 13% of all sport medicine and science studies had exclusively female participants](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/32/2/article-p114.xml), even though, roughly half of participants in athletic events nowadays, such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, would be women. Traditionally, sport science studies have the “typical 70 kg man” as a reference participant, and the findings are by proxy applied to women too. 

So, even though I spent the two years of my part-time master’s using every opportunity to research women in sport and graduated with a distinction, most of what I learnt about postnatal recovery was outside of my master’s programme. 

I was fortunate to discover [Jenny Burrell](https://www.burrelleducation.com/) and her work with pregnant and postnatal women that focused on core and pelvic floor rehabilitation – starting from breathing mechanics and soft tissue releases and building all the way up to strength and high impact exercise. 

Another great approach I found was that of the physiotherapist [Anthony Lo](https://mypteducation.com/) and his case studies of female athletes returning to sport after childbirth, often with diastasis recti and prolapse. It turns out, intra-abdominal pressure management is a motor skill you can learn and you can lift heavy after having babies, even with abdominal separation and prolapse without making them worse.

Through Antony Lo I discovered [Embodia](https://embodiaapp.com/) physiotherapy training platform and found plenty of great content there on female athletes, pelvic floors and hormones. Highly recommended for any health or fitness professional working with women!

Luckily, the sport medicine and science research is slowly picking up and there are now a couple of teams of (often all female) scientists and clinicians fighting to slowly fill the gap. In the last 3-4 years, there have been a couple of great studies on postnatal return to sport, and running in particular (Donnelly et al., 2020, 2021; Deering et al, 2020; Christopher et al., 2022; Selman et al, 2022…). I will link the studies in the resources below.

So, why did I have trouble with regulating my intra-abdominal pressure – years after my second baby was born?

Turns out I was still belly-breathing – inflating the belly at inhalation, even though I thought I didn’t. Huh! I filmed myself and noticed that my ribcage was hardly moving as I breathe in. You can see this pattern on the video below.

I also had a habit of (unknowingly) bearing down when something was heavy, especially if fatigued. This means, my perineum, especially the posterior part in my case, was moving down at exhalation instead of drawing up into the body. 

These two strategies in combination made it very difficult for my body to heal the midline. Probably with time, my pelvic floor would have started to give in too.

So, what did I do?

1.	Improved thoracic mobility – so there would be more even movement across the torso at inhalation, instead of just the belly inflating.
2.	Went back to basics and practised 360-degree breathing – evenly expanding the ribcage and the abdomen at inhalation and lifting up from the base of the torso at exhalation – first in supine, then sitting, standing and finally, in dynamic movements.

Rebuilding the foundation, I was able to offload the midsection and stop creating the outward and downward pressure. And it made a huge difference!

Another thing that stroke me, going through case studies of postnatal athletes, was that I probably often missed what was going on under the surface of my clients’ stories. In the 10+ years of my work with pregnant and postnatal women, I didn’t ask many questions about the pelvic floor. Women usually don’t share with their therapists, exercise instructors or personal trainers all the symptoms they have after the birth. Sometimes, it's just too awkward to talk about it or they just don’t think an exercise professional is a person who could help them.

But the thing is, we can. Pelvic floor is a sling of muscles and working together with the rest of the musculoskeletal system. Many pelvic floor issues can be successfully addressed by a musculoskeletal specialist, with only an external examination – indirectly, palpating the surrounding muscles. We need to pre-screen these women with well formulated questionnaires (see The Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire for ideas) and see who to further refer to an internal examination with a women’s health physio, but many of them will benefit of a musculoskeletal approach straight-away.

We need to ask the right questions and make our clients feel safe and heard. Pelvic floor health needs to be out of the taboo domain. We need to build multi-disciplinary support networks for mums returning to exercise, but in the meantime, there is a lot we can do as musculoskeletal specialists. Don’t be afraid to ask!
