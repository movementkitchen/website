My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge
for learning in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too
fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008 I left a career in corporate law with recurrent back and shoulder pain and no sensation in a half of my left foot. I found that yoga was helping my back, so I went on to study yoga. I completed 1000+ hours of yoga teacher training in Serbia, my home country, India and the UK, focusing on yoga therapy. After years of learning, teaching and dedicated daily practice I restored sensation in my whole left foot, had no back pain and even managed to grow 1.5 cm! Specialising in teaching pregnancy and postpartum yoga classes allowed me to continue teaching yoga throughout my both pregnancies and the births of my children. 

My first baby was born in 2013, by an emergency C-section that left me feeling weak and defeated. In the first days after the surgery, I could not straighten up to standing, but luckily, the scar healed well. After the routine 6-week postpartum check-up I got a green light for returning to exercise. So, I went straight back to teaching yoga and shortly after, took up teaching the advanced level at the gym. 

I was around two months postpartum when after demonstrating the "wild thing" - a pose that combines an inversion, twist and backband – I found myself with a fist-width hole in the connective tissue running across my midline. My linea alba was literally gone in that whole area. The belly was bulging and deforming at movements that used to be easy. It turned out I had a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti). For things to be even sadder, I also gradually developed De Quervain's tendinosis ("mother's wrist") on both my wrists and could not bear weight on my arms. It was incredibly frustrating to get re-injured and in pain every time I exercised or carried my baby. 

> It struck me how many postnatal issues you never ever hear about until you are unlucky to get them.

I spent 1.5 years being able to practise only very gentle pregnancy yoga. I visited numerous physios who had no idea how to help me. And then I got pregnant again. My second child was born in 2015, this time naturally, at home, but I had a 2nd-degree tear, lost a lot of blood and my abdominal separation was now around 6 fingers wide. Even at 1 year postpartum I felt weak and looked 5 months pregnant - a shopkeeper in a local grocery shop congratulated me on already being pregnant with the third child. 

I was wondering if I would ever be able to practise anything but extremely gentle low-impact exercise. Doing even a simple sun salutation or dynamic lunges would leave me with back and hip spasms for days. 

I found that there was little support offered by the healthcare and very little published research on diastasis recti, especially its connection with back and pelvic pain and dysfunction. I couldn’t find a single physiotherapist who had an experience with diastasis recti. The separation was seen as a cosmetic problem and most of the solutions focused on patching the gap instead of looking into what had caused it. 

> I couldn’t help wondering: if diastasis recti is just an aesthetic issue, why do I need a painkiller to sleep?

Looking for answers I started researching and learning across the fields of yoga, Pilates, soft tissue therapy and massage, corrective exercise, sport and exercise science, physiotherapy and women's health. I realised that diastasis recti was not a problem in itself, but a symptom of my poor intra-abdominal pressure management, non-optimal breathing and alignment habits, and muscular imbalances that would have sooner or later led to an injury – if not diastasis than a slipped disc in my spine, or a hernia, or a pelvic organ prolapse. I needed to first, relearn how to breathe and slowly build back up from there.

I started from the very basics, retraining my diaphragm, pelvic floor and the deep abdominal muscles, restored the pelvic and thoracic mobility, and gradually built motor control to move without creating excessive forward and downward pressure in my torso. With years of practice and drawbacks, I managed to restore a functional core and get stronger and more resilient than in my twenties.

In this period, I also trained as a personal trainer, Restorative Exercise Specialist, and shifted my focus from working with groups to coaching individuals, especially women with diastasis recti. While wrestling with abdominal separation, both professionally and personally, I got fascinated with the mechanisms of injuries:

> Why does an injury happen and what can we do to get out of the injurious pattern?

Digging deeper eventually brought me to an MSc in Biomechanics / Sport and Exercise Science at the University of Roehampton. I graduated in January 2021 with distinction. Sadly, I could not choose a women’s health topic for my dissertation. The University laboratory was closed during the pandemics, so I couldn’t collect data on women recreational runners with knee pain, as I originally planned. In the end, I used an existing data set on male elite master endurance athletes collected over 7 years of ageing. My dissertation on slowing down ageing with high levels of training in elite endurance runners was selected as the best in my field. In July 2022, my research was presented at the conference of the International Society of Biomechanics in Sport.

> During my studies, I was stunned by a lack of published papers and funding opportunities for research across the fields of exercise science and women's health. 

Most of biomechanics studies seemed to focus on healthy, male athletes in their twenties and there was often a sexist bias embedded in research. I was shocked to discover papers [trying to prove inferior mechanical properties of women's ligaments] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16387307/) as a possible reason for a higher rate of knee injuries in female athletes; or those proposing that there is such a thing as [a female-specific landing strategy in a jump](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14523314/) – landing “like a girl”, with knock knees, or studies recommending, on basis of disputable evidence, that [all female athletes should be put on birth control pills](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30913940/) to reduce their risk of injuries. As a recent paper published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine by an all-female multidisciplinary team of scientists eloquently puts it: ["sexism, not “sex” is a risk factor"](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/17/984.long).

Also, until recently, there was hardly any recognition of a need for postnatal rehabilitation. Female athletes would be expected to return to competitions within weeks of giving birth and without receiving adequate support. What are we then to expect for ordinary women?

In my early forties, I suddenly found myself in a waking nightmare of perimenopause. Another thing nobody ever tells you about! I found out that menopause was not just a moment when the periods stop – at once, like pressing the light switch - as I had thought. 

> Menopausal transition is a process that lasts around five years on average, and in some women might extend to over ten years. 

I thought I was losing my mind. I had brain fog, irritability and symptoms of a constant bladder infection. Thank goodness for the body identical HRT! This experience has made me further evolve my approach to exercise to meet the needs of one more transition in a women’s life.

My academic, professional and lived experience of the gap in addressing women’s health came together and I realised that I wanted to be a part of the change. Instead of staying in academia and pursuing a PhD, I wanted to use my knowledge to support women through pregnancy, postnatal rehabilitation and the menopausal transition. There are already enough scientists focused on sports and athletic performance. I want to improve the quality of life of the ordinary women, especially mums.
