Sore back when bending forward? This trick has been a game changer for many of my clients.

Having the pelvis and the ribcage stacked on top of each other, we make sure

1. The diaphragm is right on top of the pelvic floor and they can work in tune to support your spine and the organs from above and below.

2. The abdominal and back muscles in between the pelvis and the ribcage are within the optimum range of lengths where they can generate nice strong contractions (even without you having to squeeze anything) to support the torso from the front, back and sides.

Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DUDWQaMhrw0) explaining this concept.

ðŸ¦¶ Strong feet, pressing the ground away - for best results, try this barefoot first.

Try this one, save it for later ðŸ“Œ and share it with a friend who struggles with back pain.
