We will work together to figure out:    
1. What is your fitness goal?  
2. Where are you right now?  
3. What is the action plan for reaching your goal?  
4. What are the milestones and a realistic timeline? 
   
I coach online and in-person, at our East London E10 studio. 

With online sessions you log in on two devices, so we can see each of your movements from two different angles. You also get the bonus of session recordings. 

### Practical Details  
 
If we've never worked together, we'll start with a longer introductory session (duration 75 min, price £129) that includes a detailed core health and strength assessment. We are going to:

- Explore your previous injuries, surgeries, chronic health conditions, unresolved pregnancy/postpartum issues, 
- Test your abdominal wall integrity, breathing, deep core activation, pressure management, 
- Test your preferred movement strategies in different functional and sports movements, strength and endurance. 

This will allow us to make a realistic action plan for getting where you want to be.

You can take the detailed assessment as one-off or continue, in which case we will create your unique coaching package, that includes access to live Zoom calls, resources and ongoing support. The price of coaching packages depends on the duration and level of support. My hourly rate is £80.

If money is an issue, I offer a couple of Pay What You Can coaching spots each quarter. [Get in touch](mailto:ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk?subject=Scholarship) and we can figure something out.   

You can reschedule each individual session up to 24 hours beforehand.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week, we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. As you meet your milestones, we can progress further, step by step to your goal.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you get stronger. Once you master the basics, we gradually add weights and impact.

It is important to keep consistency of practice during the whole period of coaching, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the goal.
