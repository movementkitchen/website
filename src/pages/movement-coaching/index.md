In professional sports, each injured athlete receives a personalised support with an aim of returning to play quickly and fully recovered. So the rehab needs to be smart, focused and effective - setting clear milestones and reaching them one by one until the final goal. 

But what if we apply this model to, let's say, postnatal recovery? Or after having thrown out your back gardening? So, instead of going for a massage or one-off session at the physio you would go through a solid rehab plan where we will work out:

1. What is going on?
2. What was the mechanism of injury (and how to avoid it happening again)?
3. What is a realistic recovery strategy?
4. What is the timeline of your recovery and the milestones?

Step by step, with consistency and persistence you can reach your dream outcome - which might be jumping on a trampoline without leaking, running a marathon after the baby, going skiing, surfing or whatever matters to you. My task is to break this goal into smaller achievable ones.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. It’s the easiest if you tie the new exercises to an existing habit, e.g. brushing teeth or do them as a first or last thing in the day.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you build strength.

The exercises are performed slowly and with precision – working out smarter, not necessarily harder. They are meant to help you improve body awareness and build new motor skills that can translate to your chosen exercise/activity.

It is very important to keep consistency of daily practice, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the set goal.


### Practical Details

If we've never worked together, we'll start with an initial face-to-face session
(duration: 75 min, price: £100) that includes a qualitative movement assessment
and creating a strategy for your custom-made coaching package.

After this, depending on your goals and commitment, you can opt for either:

- Basic coaching package (5 sessions) - price: £400
- Full coaching package (10 sessions) - price: £700.

Each coaching package includes:

- Weekly 60 min one-to-one sessions
- Weekly action plans 
- Exercise recordings
- WhatsApp questions and catch-ups.

You can choose between in-person sessions in our East London studio, online sessions or the physical-online combination.

With online sessions you can log in on two devices, so we can have a view from two different angles. You also get the bonus of full session recordings for you to keep.

Please note that 5-week packages need to be used within 8 weeks and 10-week packages within 16 weeks.

After this, any unused sessions expire and can not be refunded. Expired sessions can be activated by puchasing another package.

You can reschedule your sessions up to 24 hours beforehand.
