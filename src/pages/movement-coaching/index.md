Movement Coaching sessions are held in our home studio in North-East London N16.
We could also arrange a session at your home, currently in North, East and
Central London, with travel expenses added to the price. Each individual session
is 60 minutes long.

In case of missed/unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date
of the last session attended.

In a typical movement coaching session, I'll ask you to stand, sit, walk and
perform simple everyday movements. We will look at your movement habits,
searching for parts of the body that move too little and those that move too
much and see what we can tweak to decrease wear and tear on individual joints
and build more balanced strength patterns.

The most important part of creating a change is between our sessions – as you
incorporate new movements/exercises into your day-to-day life, learn how to spot
patterns that might be hurting you, learn tools that will help you relieve
discomforts and prevent them in the first place - and gradually get to feel
stronger, straighter and more comfortable in your body.
