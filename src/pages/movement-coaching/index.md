title: Movement coaching
---
We will work together to figure out:
1. What is your fitness goal?
2. Where are you right now? - symptoms? movement strategies? mechanisms of injuries? strength and endurance?
3. What is the action plan for reaching your goal?
4. What are milestones and a realistic timeline?

You can choose between in-person sessions in our London E10 studio, online sessions or the physical-online combination. 

With online sessions you can log in on two devices, so we can have a view from two different angles. You also get the bonus of session recordings.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week, we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. As you meet your milestones, we can progress further, step by step to your goal.

The exercises are performed with focus and precision – working out smarter, not necessarily harder. A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you get stronger.

It is important to keep consistency of practice during the whole period of coaching, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the goal.
