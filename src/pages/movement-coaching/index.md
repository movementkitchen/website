We will work together to figure out:    
1. What is your health/fitness goal?  
2. Where are you right now?  
3. What is the action plan for reaching your goal?  
4. What are the milestones and a realistic timeline?

I coach online and in-person, at our East London E10 studio. 

With online sessions you log in on two devices, so we can see each of your movements from two different angles. You also get the bonus of session recordings. 

### Detailed Core Health And Strength Assessment  
 
If we've never worked together, we'll start with a longer introductory session (75 - 90 minutes) that includes a detailed core health and strength assessment. This is included in most packages, but you can also book it as one off (price £129).

The assessment includes:

- Looking into your previous injuries, surgeries, chronic health conditions, unresolved pregnancy or postpartum issues, 
- Testing your abdominal wall integrity, breathing, deep core activation, pressure management, 
- Testing your preferred movement strategies in different functional and sports movements, strength and endurance,
- Discussing your nutrition and food habits. 

Our goal is to see where you are and get you unstuck and moving in the right direction.

### Coaching Packages  

Each person has unique needs, so we will create your personalised coaching package with clear goals and a timeline of progress. The price of packages depends on the duration and level of support (e.g. access to Zoom calls, their frequency and duration, weekly workout schedule in the coaching app, catchups, access to resources and nutritional support). My hourly rate is £90, but packages are more cost effective. Depending on your needs and how much support you choose, you can expect to pay £250 - £400 per month.

For people on low income, I offer a couple of Pay What You Can coaching spots each quarter. [Get in touch](mailto:ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk?subject=Scholarship) and we can figure something out.   

Once booked, the individual sessions can be cancelled/rescheduled up to 24 hours beforehand. But it is important to keep consistency of practice during the whole period of coaching, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the goal.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week, we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. As you meet your milestones, we can progress further, step by step to your goal.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you get stronger. Once you master the basics, we gradually add weights and impact.
