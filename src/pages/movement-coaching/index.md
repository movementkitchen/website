### Book Movement Coaching

Movement coaching is offered as face-to-face sessions in our East London studio
and online – on Zoom or Skype.

To book mail [ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk](ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk)

We will work together over a period of 5-10 weeks, so there is enough time to
learn new motor skills and allow them to become a natural part of how you move –
on and off the mat.

You can choose between two coaching packages:

* Basic (5-week coaching) - price: £300
* Full (10-week coaching) - price: £500

Each coaching package includes:

* Weekly 1-hour one-to-one sessions
* Session recordings
* At-home-practice recommendations
* WhatsApp/email questions and catch-ups.

You can reschedule your sessions up to 24 hours beforehand. In case of
missed/unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date of the
last session attended. Continuity of the practice is the key.

Neuromuscular re-training is a process. The most important part of creating a
change is between our sessions. As you you gradually incorporate new
movements/exercises into your day-to-day life, you will get to feel stronger,
straighter and more comfortable in your body.
