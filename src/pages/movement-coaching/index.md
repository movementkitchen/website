### Practical details

You can choose between:

Basic Package (5 weekly sessions) - price: £300

Full Package (10 weekly sessions + free half foam roller) - price: £500

Each individual session is 60 minutes long. They are held in my home studio in
North-East London N16 or at your home. I currently offer one-to-ones in North,
East and Central London, with travel expenses added to the price.

In case of missed/unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date
of the last session attended.
