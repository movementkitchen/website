### What is movement coaching?

Movement coaching aims to empower you to understand and re-connect with your
body and take an active part in the healing process.

Combining alignment education and targeted corrective exercises with touch, body
awareness and breathing exercises we will work together to help you cultivate an
experience of safety and ease in your body and find safer, smarter ways to move.

We will explore together which movements feel natural and which are difficult at
this point, test your ability to stabilise your joints as you move and look for
ways to build more balanced movement patterns in your day-to-day life.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor programming. You will
learn how to isolate and control small movements, safely building towards more
complex and more physically demanding movements. The exercises are performed
slowly and with as little effort as possible until your body eventually
integrates them into the way you move everyday.

The aim of the exercises is not to challenge your abilities, but build new
neural pathways - innervating underused areas of the body so they would
gradually restore their function in your day-to-day life, optimising for better
biological performance and long-term health.

### Practical details

I offer movement coaching in packages of 5 or 10 one-to-one sessions. Each
individual session is 60 minutes long.

You can choose between:

Basic Package (5 weekly sessions): £300

Full Package (10 weekly sessions + a gratis half dome): £500

In case of missed/unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date
of the last session attended.

The sessions are held in my home studio in North London N16 or at your home. I
currently offer one-to-ones in North, East and Central London, with travel
expenses added to the price.

You might be able to share the sessions with a friend who has a similar need,
e.g. is at a similar stage in their pregnancy or postnatal recovery. Please get
in touch to find out more.
