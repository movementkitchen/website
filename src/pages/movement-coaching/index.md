### Movement coaching one-to-one

We will look for areas of tension in your body and areas of the body that don't move much, using targeted micro movements to restore strength and control and improve your ranges of motion. We will also add small alignment adjustments into your day-to-day life to improve your movement mechanics and encourage a transition to a more-movement rich lifestyle with more parts of your body participating in movement. 

My approach to working with the body includes a lot of work with the nervous system too. Using mindfulness and somatic tools of [proprioception](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46796/title/Proprioception--The-Sense-Within/) and [interoception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12965300) we will explore your experience of movement together. Progressing slowly, tweaking a parameter at a time we allow the body to pick up, gradually growing into a healthier alignment without force and straining, so it slowly becomes the new normal.
