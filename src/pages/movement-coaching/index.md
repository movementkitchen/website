### What is Precision Rehab Movement Coaching?

In professional sports, each injured athlete receives a personalised support with an aim of returning to play quickly and fully recovered. So the rehab needs to be smart, focused and effective - setting clear milestones and reaching them one by one until the final goal. 

But what if we apply this model to let's say postnatal recovery? Or after having thrown out your back gardening? So, instead of going for a massage or one-off session at the physio you would go through a solid rehab plan where we will work out:

1. What is going on?
2. What was the mechanism of injury (and how to avoid it happening again)?
3. What is a realistic recovery strategy?
4. What is the timeline of your recovery and the milestones?

Step by step, with consistency and persistence you can reach your dream outcome - which might be jumping on a trampoline without leaking, running a marathon after the baby, going skiing, surfing or whatever matters to you. My task is to break this goal into smaller achievable ones.

### Practical Details

To book your free 10-min telephone consultation email [ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk](ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk) or WhatsApp me on 07935348233. 

If we've never worked together, we'll start with an initial face-to-face session
(duration: 75 min, price: £100) that includes a qualitative movement assessment
and creating a strategy for your custom-made coaching package.

After this, depending on your goals and commitment, you can opt for either:

- Basic coaching package (5 sessions) - price: £400
- Full coaching package (10 sessions) - price: £700.

You can choose between face-to-face sessions in our East London studio, online coaching on Zoom/Skype or the physical-online combination.

Each coaching package includes:

- Weekly 60 min one-to-one sessions
- Weekly action plans 
- Exercise recordings
- WhatsApp questions and catch-ups.

You can reschedule your sessions up to 24 hours beforehand. In case of missed or
unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date of the last
session attended.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. It’s the easiest if you tie the new exercises to an existing habit – e.g. brushing teeth or do them as a first or last thing in the day.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you build strength.

The exercises are performed slowly and with precision – working out smarter, not necessarily harder. They are meant to help you improve body awareness and build new motor skills that can translate to your chosen exercise/activity.

It is very important to keep consistency of daily practice, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the set goal.
