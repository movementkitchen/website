### What to expect from you session?

The one to one sessions are usually one hour long. We will look into the ways
you use your body, focusing on the positioning of the bones and joint angles and
find what we can improve for a better biological performance. We will explore
together which movements feel natural and which are difficult at this point and
test your ability to stabilise your joints as you move. The aim is to gradually
build more sustainable use patterns that will bring about more balanced mass and
bone density distribution and better overall tissue quality - decreasing the
likelihood that some parts of your body would wear out prematurely.

Even though largely relying on mechanics and geometry in my work, I don't see
the body as a machine that needs to be ''fixed'' but rather a complex expression
of our emotions, habits and cultural conditioning, of the way we see ourselves
and experience the world around us.

A lot of my work focuses on the nervous system and motor programming, learning
how to isolate and control small movements, improving your proprioception and
coordination. The practices are performed slowly and with as little effort as
possible, giving a lot of attention to body awareness.

The aim of the exercises is not to challenge your abilities, but build new
neural pathways - innervating underused areas of the body so they would
gradually restore their function in your day-to-day life.

I also play a lot with interoception (sense of psychological condition of the
body) and experience of movement. I like using mindfulness, breath, touch and
somatic imagery to aid you in overcoming old muscular habits and help cultivate
an experience of safety and ease in your body.
