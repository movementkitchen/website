We will work together to figure out:    
1. What is your health/fitness goal?  
2. Where are you right now?  
3. What is the action plan for reaching your goal?  
4. What are the milestones and a realistic timeline?

I coach online and in-person, at our East London E10 studio. 

With online sessions you log in on two devices, so we can see each of your movements from two different angles. You also get the bonus of session recordings. 

### How coaching works  
 
If we've never worked together, we'll start with a detailed health and strength assessment. This is included in most packages, but you can also book it as one off (price £100).

The assessment includes:

- Looking into your previous injuries, surgeries, chronic health conditions, unresolved pregnancy or postpartum issues, 
- Testing your abdominal wall integrity, breathing, deep core activation, pressure management, 
- Testing your preferred movement strategies in different functional and sports movements, strength and endurance,
- Discussing your nutrition and food habits. 

Our goal is to see where you are and get you unstuck and moving in the right direction.

### Coaching Packages  

Each person has unique needs, so we will create your personalised coaching package with clear goals and a timeline of progress. The price of packages will depend on the duration and level of support (number of 1:1 sessions, their frequency and duration, access to the coaching app, workout schedules, What'sApp support, access to resources and nutritional support). My hourly rate is £80.

For people on low income, I offer a couple of Pay What You Can coaching spots each quarter. [Get in touch](mailto:ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk?subject=Scholarship) and we can figure something out.

Once booked, the individual sessions can be cancelled/rescheduled up to 24 hours beforehand. But it is important to keep consistency of practice during the whole period of coaching, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the goal.
