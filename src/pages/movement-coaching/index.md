### What is movement coaching?

Movement coaching aims to empower you to take an active part in the healing
process.

We will explore together which movements feel natural and which are difficult at
this point, test your ability to stabilise your joints as you move and look for
ways to build more balanced movement patterns in your day-to-day life.

Combining alignment education and targeted corrective exercises with touch, body
awareness and breathing exercises we will work together to help you cultivate an
experience of safety and ease in your body and find safer, smarter ways to move.

A lot of my work focuses on the nervous system and motor programming. You will
learn how to isolate and control small movements, safely building towards more
complex and more physically demanding movements. The exercises are performed
slowly and with as little effort as possible until your body eventually
integrates them into the way you move everyday.

The aim of the exercises is not to challenge your abilities, but build new
neural pathways - innervating underused areas of the body so they would
gradually restore their function in your day-to-day life, optimising for better
biological performance and long-term health.
