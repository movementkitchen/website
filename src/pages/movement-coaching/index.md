I coach online and in-person, at our East London E10 studio. 

With online sessions you log in on two devices, so we can see each of your movements from two different angles. You also get the bonus of session recordings.

If we never worked together, you will need a [*Detailed Core Health and Strength Assessment - Initial Consultation*](https://movementkitchen.simplybook.it/v2/#book/service/36/count/1/). In this 1.5 hour session we will explore:

1. Your health and fitness history
2. Where are you right now? - breathing, pressure management, preferred movement strategies in different functional and sports movements, motor control, strength, endurance
3. What is your goal?
4. What is the action plan for reaching your goal?
5. What are the milestones and a realistic timeline?

*During the month of June, we have a 30% discount on the initial assessments. So, instead of £129 you pay £90. Just type in the promotion code JUNE24* [when making the payment](https://buy.stripe.com/7sI01u2WX4YVdzy5kn).

After the initial assessment, we can create your unique coaching package where besides coaching you get access to resources and ongoing support. I usually work with people over a period of 12 - 16 months of weekly coaching and then move on to maintanance sessions 2-3 times a month or short catchups. The price of coaching packages ranges from £250 - £375 per month depending on the level of support. If booking individual sessions, my hourly rate is £90.

### What to Expect

In the early stages of coaching, you will learn tools to relieve pain so you can handle flare-ups. As we progress, we will work on preventing the pain before it happens.

Each week, we will create an action plan with exercises that you can practise until your next session. As you meet your milestones, we can progress further, step by step to your goal.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor control. You will learn how to isolate and control small movements, building towards more complex and more physically demanding movements as you get stronger. Once you master the basics, we gradually add weights and impact.

It is important to keep consistency of practice during the whole period of coaching, so you can meet your weekly milestones and progress towards the goal.
