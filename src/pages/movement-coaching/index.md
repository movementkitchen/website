Movement coaching is offered as face-to-face sessions in our East London studio
and on Zoom. We will work together over a period of 6-12 weeks, so there is
enough time to learn new motor skills and allow them to become a natural part of
how you move – in both exercise and daily life.

If we've never worked together, we'll start with an initial face-to-face session
(duration: 75 min, price: £100) that includes a qualitative movement assessment
and creating an action plan for your custom-made coaching package.

After this, depending on your time and commitment, you can choose between:

- Basic coaching package (6 sessions) - price: £400
- Full coaching package (12 sessions) - price: £720.

Each package includes:

- Weekly 60 min one-to-one sessions
- Session recordings
- Homework/practice recommendations
- WhatsApp/email questions and catch-ups.

You can reschedule your sessions up to 24 hours beforehand. In case of
missed/unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date of the
last session attended. Continuity of the practice is the key.

Neuromuscular re-training is a process. The most important part of creating a
change is between our sessions. As you you gradually incorporate new
movements/exercises into your day-to-day life, you will get to feel stronger,
straighter and more comfortable in your body.
