I can help you overcome pain and disfunction in your body with targeted corrective exercises and little lifestyle adjustments. 

These sessions are for you if you have any of the following: recurrent back, hip or foot pain, diastasis recti, pelvic pain, stress incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, repetitive strain injuries, you generally feel weak and unable to carry your children or groceries or walk for longer without discomfort. 

You will also find them helpful if you are trying to recover from an injury or surgery, you are pregnant or a new mum, you would like to transition to barefoot shoes or generally improve your functional strength.

You can chose to have a session in my home studio in Hackney or at your home. I currently offer classes in North, Central and East London, with travel expenses added to the price.

All sessions need to be paid in advance and can be moved or canceled up to 24 hours before the appointment.

### My approach 

I use Restorative Exercise/Nutritious Movement as a starting point in my work. Using 25 objective alignment markers grounded in the principles of geometry, engineering and physics we will work together to align your bones and joints in relation to each other allowing the muscles to gradually restore their optimum length and function. You can find out more about this approach at the [Nutritious Movement website](http://nutritiousmovement.com/).

I work a lot with proprioception and motor programming - helping you learn how to isolate and control small movements. Your brain is like GPS constantly receiving sensory motor information. Sometimes when you are in pain the signal gets mixed up and your brain shuts down the information because it's not helpful. And once the GPS is back on it might be that some of the communication centres are not sending signal. So often, it might be necessary to get the brain to start talking to a muscle first before restoring its function. 

A good part of my work is with the nervous system and interoception (sense of psychological condition of the body) using mindfulness, body awareness and somatic imagery to aid in removing old muscular habits. 

At the end of each session you will get a recommendation of corrective exercises and little alignment tweaks to add into your everyday life to improve your movement mechanics and help you transition to a healthy, active lifestyle.
