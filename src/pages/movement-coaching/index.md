Movement coaching is offered as face-to-face sessions in our East London studio
and on Zoom.

We will work together over a period of 5-10 weeks, so there is enough time to
learn new motor skills and allow them to become a natural part of how you move –
in both exercise and daily life.

If we've never worked together, we'll start with an initial face-to-face session
(duration: 75 min, price: £100) that includes a qualitative movement assessment
and creating an action plan for your custom-made coaching package.

After this, depending on your time and commitment, you can choose between:

- Basic coaching package (5 sessions) - price: £400
- Full coaching package (10 sessions) - price: £700.

Each package includes:

- Weekly 60 min one-to-one sessions
- Session recordings
- Homework/practice recommendations
- WhatsApp or email questions and catch-ups.

You can reschedule your sessions up to 24 hours beforehand. In case of missed or
unused sessions, the package expires four weeks after the date of the last
session attended.

Neuromuscular retraining is a process that requires time and dedication. The
change comes about gradually through continuity of practice in the sessions and
in between them.
