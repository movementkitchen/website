## Get Your Emergency Back Pain Toolkit

Learn how to handle recurring back pain flare-ups, soothe the pain with gentle movement, self-massage, releases and breathing exercises and prevent back pain as you exercise and progress your training.  

Please leave your email below to access your Back Pain Toolkit. Your email address will be added to our mailing list with high quality content on the overlap of exercise science, healthy ageing and women's health. I send emails once or twice a month. If that's not your cup of tea, you can unsubscribe at any point.
