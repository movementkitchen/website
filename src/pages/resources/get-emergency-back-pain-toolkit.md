### In case of emergency, break the glass!

Here is a cheatsheet with steps you can follow every time your back flares up to get you on your feet and back to training ASAP.

### In one place, you'll find the most effective emergency pain relief tools we use in rePower to "unstuck" your back within hours:  

1. *Restorative positions* - that use strategic positioning to release muscles with the pull of gravity, while you just lie there  
2. Simple and effective *self-massage techniques* you can do at home, with simple and readily-available tools (like a rolled up towel) to soothe your back and hips 
3. My favourite back-unstucking *mobility and strength sequence* that helps my clients get out of a flare-up and back to work the next day.

You will also learn breathing and relaxation techniques we use in rePower to help you *restore a healthy core activation* after the flare-up, so you are ready to get back to training. You can learn how to restore healthy torso mechanics after back pain in more detail in our [online course](https://movementkitchen.onlinecoursehost.com/courses/emergency-back-pain-toolkit).

Finally, you'll get some tips on *progressing your training with history of back pain*, and how to recognise that you've gone too far and stop, maybe even before the pain comes.

*Please leave your email below to access your Cheatsheet*. This will add you to our mailing list to receive monthly light-hearted but evidence-based articles on the overlap of exercise science, women's health and longevity. Hope you will enjoy them.
