## Get Your Emergency Back Pain Toolkit

In case of emergency, break the glass! Here is my ultimate set of tools to help you handle recurring back pain flare-ups and protect your back as you exercise and progress your training.  

Please leave your email below to access your Back Pain Toolkit. Your email address will be added to our mailing list with high quality content on the overlap of exercise science, healthy ageing and women's health. I send emails once or twice a month. If that's not your cup of tea, you can unsubscribe at any point.
