### Stronger After the Baby 8-Week Course

This course can be a kick-start to your journey of overcoming an abdominal separation or a pelvic floor disorder and restoring a functional core.

Amongst other, we will explore:

How to assess integrity of your abdominal fascia, meet your body where it is and
follow along as it changes

What breathing has to do with a responsive abdominal and pelvic floor muscles

How to build solid foundations for exercise and safely progress up your exercise
intensity

How tight shoulders, hips and feet might be weakening your abdomen and what to
do about it

How to make sure your core is working and stabilising the body dynamically as you move your arms and legs, add extra load and eventually add impact

You will improve your body awareness, learn how to move with more precision and
adapt any mode of exercise to meet your abilities through both setback and
getting stronger.

Suitable for women of any age, from new mums (6 weeks postnatal) onwards, no
matter how long ago you've had the baby.
