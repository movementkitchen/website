### Upcoming courses and workshops

#### Whole Body Core Strength 6-Week Course

Starting on the 18th of March

Do you have persistent back pain, back spasms or sciatica that significantly
affect your quality of life? Do you feel your abdomen is too weak to support you
while carrying groceries or lifting your children? Or maybe you had your
children years ago but still look five months pregnant? Do you leak when you
cough or sneeze?

If any of these is true this course is a perfect place to start.

  mobility and a balanced strength of the pelvic musculature. Developing a
  healthy alignment will transform your walking into a powerful
  health-sustaining activity. Perfect for anyone with foot, knee, hip or back
  pain or pelvic floor disorders. All the sessions are outside, walking in

### What if you miss a session in a course

You can make up one session you missed in the next term for free, if there is
space. For every next one you will need to pay the regular drop-in price which
is £30 for the workshops and £20 for the exercise classes.

Another option would be to book a 1 hour private where we would go through the
bits that you missed. I could give you a 20% discount on the regular price.

We are slowly building up complexity as each week is dedicated to developing a
different motor skill and adding it to the previous ones. I really want to make
sure that everyone fully benefits from the course, so if you miss more than two
sessions it might make more sense to re-book the whole course in the next term
or once you are ready to commit.
