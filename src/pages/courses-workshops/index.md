Other courses coming up soon:

### Resilient Mama

This 6 week course brings together gentle pregnancy yoga with biomechanics based
Restorative Exercise to help you go through your pregnancy feeling your best.
Through these six weeks we will explore healthy alignment in pregnancy and how
to avoid common niggles of the increased weight and decreased space for
breathing, pelvic floor health beyond isolated pelvic floor exercises and how to
prepare the body for birth. It will help you build body awareness, functional
strength and emotional resilience for a smooth transition into motherhood.

### Walking for Health

What if you can significantly improve your health just by walking? This 6 week
course focuses on restoring foot dexterity, lower leg mobility and a balanced
strength of the pelvic musculature. Developing a healthy alignment will
transform your walking into a powerful health-sustaining activity. Perfect for
anyone with foot, knee, hip or back pain or pelvic floor disorders. All the
sessions are outside, walking in nature.

### Parkour for Mums

This playful outdoor movement workshop explores all the things you can do while
your children play at the playground to strengthen your body. Hint: it's not
looking at your phone :)

### What if you miss a session in a course

You can make up one session you missed in the next term for free, if there is
space. For every next one you will need to pay the regular drop-in price which
is £30 for the workshops and £25 for the movement classes. Another option would
be to book a 1 hour private where we would go through the bits that you missed.

We are slowly building up complexity as each week is dedicated to developing a
different motor skill and adding it to the previous ones. I really want to make
sure that everyone fully benefits from the course, so if you miss more than two
sessions it might make more sense to re-book the whole course in the next term
or once you are ready to commit.
