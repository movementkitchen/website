### Upcoming courses and workshops

#### Whole Body Core Strength 6-Week Course

Starting on the 18th of March

After the first, sold out Whole Body Core Strength course I've decided to offer
a re-run this spring.

This unique course brings together private movement coaching, small group
classes and experiential workshops exploring the idea of ''core strength'', so
much used in the mainstream health and fitness community and challenging its
meaning beyond the tight abs.

Why some people don't respond well to conventional abdominal exercise?

Do you really have to pull your navel to the spine to activate your core?

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet have to do with the weak core?

How to notice and stop creating forces that keep weakening your core?

How to tweak the way you stand, sit, walk, use your arms and legs to allow more
parts of your body to switch on and gradually strengthen through the use in your
daily life?

How to get over recurrent injuries and live an active life without some parts of
your body wearing out before the other ones?

### What if you miss a session in a course

You can make up one session you missed in the next term for free, if there is
space. For every next one you will need to pay the regular drop-in price which
is £30 for the workshops and £20 for the exercise classes.

Another option would be to book a 1 hour private where we would go through the
bits that you missed. I could give you a 20% discount on the regular price.

We are slowly building up complexity as each week is dedicated to developing a
different motor skill and adding it to the previous ones. I really want to make
sure that everyone fully benefits from the course, so if you miss more than two
sessions it might make more sense to re-book the whole course in the next term
or once you are ready to commit.
