### Whole Body Core Strength 8-Week Physical + Digital Course

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I've learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines small group classes / experiential workshops with
digital content – short videos and readings that you can go through at home and
keep coming back to as a reference as you build up your personal movement
practice.

Challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight abs, Whole Body Core
Strength aims to equip your with tools to gradually strengthen your body from
inside out.

Amongst other, we will explore:

Why some people don't respond well to conventional abdominal exercise?

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet has to do with the weak abdomen?

How to notice and stop creating forces that keep weakening your core?

Using isolated small movements we will search for your body's "blind spots"
restoring mobility in the underused areas and building more balanced strength
patterns.

We will discover movements that make you hurt and find a way to do them in a
safer, smarter way that will help your tissues heal and strengthen.

You will learn how to improve your alignment, reduce wear and tear on your
joints and get more of your muscles to participate as you exercise, practice
yoga or pilates or simply live your life.

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.

* Price: £180 - includes the digital content for week 1 + 7 weekly movement
  classes at our studio in North Hackney or one of our partner studios + follow
  up readings and practice videos

next start date and place and book your spot.

Upon the completion of the course you will have an option to join a 6-week
continuation, if you want to go further. These are weekly movement
classes/workshops playing with and building onto the motor skills from the basic
course. The price is £120 for the full 6 weeks or 2. We will focus on improving
your strength-to-weight ratio – especially through re-introducing developmental
movements such as crawling and hanging and support you in building robust
functional strength.
