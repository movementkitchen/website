### Whole Body Core Strength 8-Week In-person Course + Online Resources

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I've learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines in-person small group weekly workshops with short
educational and exercise videos that you can go through at home and keep coming
back to as a reference as you build up your personal movement practice.

Challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight abs, Whole Body Core
Strength aims to equip your with tools to gradually strengthen your body from
inside out.

Amongst other, we will explore:

How to assess integrity of your abdominal fascia and meet your body where it is

Why breathing muscles are your core muscles

What tight shoulders, hips and feet have to do with the weak core

Why compromised core is often an issue of communication not a lack of muscle
strengthening

Using targeted precise exercises we will look for your body's blind spots,
aiming to restore mobility in the underused areas and build more balanced
strength patterns.

You will learn how to identify movements that make you hurt and find a way to do
them in a safer, smarter way that will help your tissues heal and strengthen.

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the groups are small
and each of the practices will be adapted to you.
