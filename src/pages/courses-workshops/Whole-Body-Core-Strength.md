### Whole Body Core Strength 8-Week Physical + Digital Course

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I've learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines small group classes / experiential workshops with
digital content – short videos and readings that you can go through at home and
keep coming back to as a reference as you build up your personal movement
practice.

Challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight abs, Whole Body Core
Strength aims to equip your with tools to gradually strengthen your body from
inside out.

Amongst other, we will explore:

Why some people don't respond well to conventional abdominal exercise?

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet has to do with the weak abdomen?

How to notice and stop creating forces that keep weakening your core?

Using isolated small movements we will search for your body's "blind spots"
restoring mobility in the underused areas and building more balanced strength
patterns.

We will discover movements that make you hurt and find a way to do them in a
safer, smarter way that will help your tissues heal and strengthen.

You will learn how to improve your alignment, reduce wear and tear on your
joints and get more of your muscles to participate as you exercise, practice
yoga or pilates or simply live your life.

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.

Place: Kuu London  
76 Lower Clapton Rd  
E5 0RN London

Time: Saturdays 9:30 - 10:45 am

* Price: £199

Upon the completion of the course you will have an option to join a 6-week
continuation, if you want to go further. These will be weekly movement classes
playing with and building onto the motor skills you've learnt. We will focus on
improving your strength-to-weight ratio – especially through re-introducing
developmental movements such as crawling and hanging and support you in building
robust functional strength. Schedule and price of the 6-week continuation course
will depend on the number of participants.
