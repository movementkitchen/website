### Whole Body Core Strength 8-Week Physical + Digital Course

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I've learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines small group classes / experiential workshops with
digital content – short videos and readings that you can go through at home and
keep coming back to as a reference as you build up your personal movement
practice.

Challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight abs, Whole Body Core
Strength aims to equip your with tools to gradually strengthen your body from
inside out.

Amongst other, we will explore:

Why breathing muscles are your core muscles

Why weak core is often an issue of communication not a lack of muscle
strengthening

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet has to do with the weak abdomen

We will look for movements that make you hurt and find a way to do them in a
safer, smarter way that will help your tissues heal and strengthen.

Using isolated small movements we will search for your body's "blind spots"
restoring mobility in the underused areas and building more balanced strength
patterns.

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.

* Price: £180 - includes the digital content for week 1 + 7 weekly movement
  classes at our studio in North Hackney or one of our partner studios + follow
  up readings and practice videos
