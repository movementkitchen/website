### Whole Body Core Strength 6-Week Course

**Starting on 15 September**

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I've learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines focussed small group classes and experiential
workshops challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight abs.

Why some people don't respond well to conventional abdominal exercise?

Do you really have to pull your navel to the spine for your abdominal muscles to
work?

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet has to do with the weak abdomen?

How to notice and stop creating forces that keep weakening your core?

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.

Extras: by booking the course you also get:

* Access to digital content – short videos containing the theoretical
  foundations and follow up exercises to help you establish your home practice

Place: Kuu London  
76 Lower Clapton Rd
