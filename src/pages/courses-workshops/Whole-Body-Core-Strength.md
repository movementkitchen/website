### Whole Body Core Strength 6-Week Course

**Starting on the 4th of March**

You might be told that having back pain, a weak abdomen, a leaky pelvic floor or
aches and pains that keep coming back is a normal consequence of pregnancy,
childbirth or your age. You might be investing a lot of time and effort in
strengthening or restoring your core, while at the same time creating forces
that weaken it. This course aims to help you in uncovering the habits that might
be weakening your core and support you in establishing sustainable movement
patterns that will help your body overcome the weakness and strengthen from
inside out.

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

It's a 6-week course combining private and small group movement coaching with
educational workshops and customised take-home practices.

Perfect for anyone who is interested in exploring how their body works and would
like to improve their biological fitness and functional strength, especially new
mums, people with recurring back or pelvic pain and diastasis recti.

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.
