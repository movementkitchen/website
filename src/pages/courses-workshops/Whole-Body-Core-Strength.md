### Whole Woman Core Strength 8-Week Course

This course brings together everything I've learnt through my professional and
personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and restoring a
functional core.

Focussing specifically on women with diastasis recti, pelvic floor disorders,
back pain and weakened core, it combines in-person small group workshops with
short educational and exercise videos that you can go through at home and keep
coming back to as a reference.

Challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the flat belly and six-pack,
Whole Woman Core Strength aims to equip your with tools to gradually strengthen
your body from inside out, so you can go back to more intense exercise and an
active lifestyle.

Amongst other, we will explore:

How to assess integrity of your abdominal fascia, meet your body where it is and
follow along as it changes

What breathing has to do with a responsive abdominal and pelvic floor muscles

How tight shoulders, hips and feet might be weakening your abdomen and what to
do about it

How to build solid foundations for exercise and safely progress up your exercise
intensity

You will improve your body awareness, learn how to move with more precision and
adapt any mode of exercise to meet your abilities through both setback and
getting stronger.

Suitable for women of any age, from new mums (6 weeks postnatal) onwards, no
matter how long ago you've had the baby.
