### Whole Body Core Strength 6-Week Course

**Starting on the 18th of March**

Whole Body Core Strength brings together everything I learnt through my
professional and personal journey of healing a severe abdominal separation and
restoring a functional core.

This unique course combines private movement coaching, small group classes and
experiential workshops challenging the meaning of core strength beyond the tight
abs.

Why some people don't respond well to conventional abdominal exercise?

Do you really have to pull your navel to the spine for your abdominal muscles to
work?

What tightness in your shoulders/hips/feet have to do with the weak abdomen?

How to notice and stop creating forces that keep weakening your core?

Suitable for beginners as well as experienced movers, as the group is small and
each of the practices will be adapted to you.
