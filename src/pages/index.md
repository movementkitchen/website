  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Movement Kitchen offers evidence-based precision training for women that bridges physiotherapy and strength and conditioning -addressing women's musculoskeletal, pelvic, and hormonal needs during different life stages (such as pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause, and menopause). 

You might feel that conventional exercise isnot serving you well – you keep getting injured at the gym or hurt for daysafter training. Or maybe you live with a chronic health condition likeendometriosis, pelvic organ prolapse or back pain and want to find a way toexercise and get stronger without aggravating symptoms. 

Maybe you are an expectant mum unsure how to adapt your training as your pregnancy progresses or a postpartummum who wants to reclaim a strong body after having a baby and return toexercise or competitive sports. Or maybe you had a baby years ago, but your core and the pelvic floor never fully recovered.  

You might be going through perimenopause and want to build training to help you gain muscle, increase energylevels and feel your best through the menopausal transition. Or maybe you arepost-menopausal, looking to build strength, improve pelvic health, build strongbones and stay active for decades to come. 

Working together, we will create an actionplan with weekly milestones to help you reach your health and fitness goals –from rehab to performance.
