A lot of disease and dysfunction in the body that we commonly attribute to age, pregnancy, childbirth or accidental injuries can be traced back to mechanical causes. This means that they can be significantly reduced or even avoided altogether by changing the way you move. Improving how parts of your body work together and in relation to each other will bring different outcomes on cellular level, such as less wear and tear on the joints, better bone density and generally a more robust strength with less likelihood for injury.

Movement Kitchen brings together modern science approaches to movement and body grounded in biomechanics, physics and human kinetics with mindfulness and yoga as therapy. It aims to empower you to improve your movement mechanics, restore your bodyâ€™s biological function and rediscover ease and joy in moving.
