> The approach of Movement Kitchen focusses on building functional, real-life strength, optimising for a body that is able to smoothly perform all its biological functions.

Improving how the parts of your body work together and in relation to each other can help heal and prevent injuries. Moving more sustainably will bring different outcomes on cellular level, such as better bone density, less wear and tear on the joints, and generally a more balanced strength and improved biological performance. 

Movement Kitchen brings together modern science approaches to body and movement grounded in biomechanics, physics and human kinetics with mindfulness and yoga as therapy.

We will look for areas of tension in your body and areas of the body that don't move much, using targeted micro movements to restore strength and control and improve your ranges of motion. We will also add small alignment adjustments into your day-to-day life to improve your movement mechanics and encourage a transition to a more-movement rich lifestyle with more parts of your body participating in movement. 

My approach to working with the body includes a lot of work with the nervous system too. Using mindfulness, breath and somatic tools of proprioception and interoception we will explore your experience of movement together. Progressing slowly, tweaking a parameter at a time we allow the body to pick up, gradually growing into a healthier alignment without force and straining, so it slowly becomes the new normal. 

Short about me: I'm a movement teacher, biomechanics geek and a mum to two energetic little people. My background brings together yoga as therapy, mindfulness and somatics and years of working with movement and the body. I am now in the final year of my RES Certification with Nutritious Movement under biomechanist Katy Bowman, focused on Restorative Exercise and functional strength. I am passionate about working with new mums and mums to be and people with chronic pain.
