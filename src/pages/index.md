  text: After 10 years of chronic pain, dizziness, headaches, bad mood, money wasted on different doctors, therapies, exercises… I tried it all… I can finally live my life like a normal person. This experience helped me reconnect with my body, be pain free, learn how to move freely and maintain my wellbeing. In just 2 weeks all my symptoms were gone and I was able to trust my body again and rebuild my strength.

  text: Ivana has been a beam of hope for me. I was really considering surgery. I'm so glad that I found her because through her coaching I have learnt so much about the feet and their connections through the legs and pelvic floor. Everything aligns. I've noticed such an improvement that I don't have to buy tops which are a size bigger to fit my belly. I also feel stronger and reconnected to my core, now I know how it works and my awareness is better.

  text: I started working with Ivana after seeing the amazing progress my husband has being experiencing with her. I initially sought help for my back pain, and I have been consistently impressed with the results over the past few months. Not only has my back pain improved, but I've also noticed a significant increase in my overall well-being.

### Are you trying to live an active lifestyle, but your back pain keeps coming back. 

You try exercising but keep pulling your back out at the gym or in fitness classes. You've tried physiotherapy. Yoga. Pilates. Core strengthening. Maybe they helped temporarily, but the pain returned. You wonder if you're broken, doing it wrong, or this is just normal. Everyone has back pain in midlife. Or don't they? Back pain is "normal as we get older".

Well, I wouldn't agree with you. I had chronic back pain in my 20s and 30s, but I don't have back pain now im my mid 40s. Even though I lift weights. 

I'm Ivana, a 46-year-old mum of two and a biomechanics cientist, back pain to performance specialist. I am passionate about women's health and performance - both biological and athletic and have published research on slowing down ageing with high levels of training. I've created rePower Method based on the 13+ years of experience coaching people with recurring back pain and those whose bodies wouldn't respond to training. It's a 3-phase system designed to help you move from back pain to performance-based training. Challenging the body with kindness, always.

Is your back flared-up? Download our Free Back Pain Toolbox mini online course to get you out of pain and stiffness by tomorrow.

Do you need help solving your recurrent back pain mystery? I'd be happy to lend you my brain. Book a 45-min back pain pattern assessment in our East London E10 studio or online. We have 30% during the month of September. [Drop me an email](mailto:ivana@movementkitchen.co.uk?subject=Scholarship) to book.
