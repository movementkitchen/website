Improving how the parts of your body work together and in relation to each other can help heal and prevent injuries. Moving more sustainably will bring different outcomes on cellular level, such as better bone density, less wear and tear on the joints, and generally a more balanced strength and improved biological performance. 

Movement Kitchen brings together modern science approaches to body and movement grounded in biomechanics, physics and human kinetics with mindfulness and yoga as therapy.

> The focus is on building real-life strength, optimising for a body that is able to smoothly perform all its biological functions.

We will look for areas of tension in your body and areas of the body that don't move much, using targeted micro movements to restore strength and control and improve your ranges of motion. We will also add small alignment adjustments into your day-to-day life to improve your movement mechanics and encourage a transition to a more-movement rich lifestyle with more parts of your body participating in movement. 

My approach to working with the body includes a lot of work with the nervous system too. Using mindfulness and somatic tools of [proprioception](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46796/title/Proprioception--The-Sense-Within/) and [interoception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12965300) we will explore your experience of movement together. Progressing slowly, tweaking a parameter at a time we allow the body to pick up, gradually growing into a healthier alignment without force and straining, so it slowly becomes the new normal.
