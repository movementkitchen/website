  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Do you have an injury that keeps coming back? You try exercising at the gym,
running, practising yoga or Pilates but keep getting hurt? Do you have back pain
every time you lift or carry your child or grandchild? Or maybe you feel that
things never quite got back to normal post-baby? You might have tried various
approaches with mixed results but the pain keeps returning.

Are you a curious mind, interested in understanding why you get injured and
determined to step by step reclaim a strong body and an active lifestyle,
whatever that might mean for you? Precision rehab personal training could be the very thing you are looking for.

Our unique, evidence-based approach bridges the gap between physiotherapy and
strength and conditioning. Using an elite athlete coaching approach, we will
figure out together:

1. What is the problem?
2. Why did it happen?
3. What is the recovery strategy?
4. What is the timeline of recovery and return to your chosen physical activity
   (running, weight training, dance, gardening, carrying your children)?

This is a great place to start strengthening your abdominal muscles after pregnancy and childbirth or abdominal surgery. You can try this sequence as soon as you get a green light from your doctor. We need to make sure the lower segments of the abdominal muscles are responding to breathing before adding the leg movements. Make sure you can maintain an easy, flowing breath as you move through the sequence. You might want to practise only the exercises with the pelvis on the ground at first, and once they feel easy, you can progress to keeping the pelvis slightly above the ground.

This is my favourite little pick-me-up sequence lately, integrating hand, arm and calf exercises in this short but punchy whole-body workout.

I find that my clients often skip calf exercises. So now we try and sneak them into larger movements. The same thing with hand exercises, hardly anyone will find the time to do them in isolation.

For an extra calf (soleus muscle) challenge, add a series of dynamic bent knees calf raises/heel drops into each version of the squats.

Can you have a strong upper body workout with a weakened core?

Yes, you can. As long as you make sure that:

1. Your/your client's intraabdominal pressure is in check
2. Their abdominal muscles are able to switch on across all layers and
3. They use arms without straining the midsection.

Diastasis recti is technically a repetitive strain injury, as it is linked to certain movement and breathing patterns that strain the tendinous tissue running across the front of the abdomen, which then keeps getting reinjured and takes a while to heal.

The only way to rebuild a tendinous tissue is to load it. But you want to make sure that the 3 checkboxes above are always ticked. This means, increasing weight/intensity very gradually.

Here is a short upper body sequence I've recorded for a client of mine, a mum healing from diastasis recti who is just starting to work with small weights.

We used the stick exercises as a buildup towards the biceps and triceps weights exercises, challenging the stabilising muscles of the upper torso to work both eccentrically and concentrically before adding the extra weight.

Variations:

1. Pulling the stick apart
2. Compressing the stick (pulling the sides to the middle).

Some useful hints:

* Strong feet, pressing into the ground.
* Easy flowing breath throughout the movement. We also used a humming sound at exhalation, to help her engage transverse abdominals organically.
* Hold the stick in front of you with the elbows pointing down - externally rotated arms.
* The arms move only as far up as it is possible without the rib flare or the shoulder girdle lifting up.
* As the arms bend, the elbows point forward and press towards each other (I find it helpful to imagine holding a beach ball in between the elbows) - to avoid internal rotation of the humerus and stabilise the elbow in all three planes.
