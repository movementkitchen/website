Do you have recurring back pain, a repetitive strain injury or feel that things never quite got back to normal after having a baby? Have you ever tried movement coaching?

Movement Kitchen brings together modern science approaches to movement and body grounded in biomechanics, physics and human kinetics with mindfulness and yoga as therapy.

It aims to:

* Empower you to improve your movement mechanics and regain ease in moving
* Help you overcome pain and fear of getting re-injured
* Support you in building more sustainable alignment habits in your day-to-day life
* Support you in transitioning to an active, movement-rich lifestyle
* Put you on the right path towards developing a robust functional strength
