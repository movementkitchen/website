    text: For someone who hasn't done yoga or movement workshops before I found working with Ivana really useful - she was great at explaining what the each exercise was about. I learnt a lot and am looking forward to fixing my body.

    text: Ivana was really supportive as I went to her studio with my newborn and she not only helped me to better understand how to recover my diastasis, but even managed to calm and put my baby to sleep while explaining and training me.

Do you have an injury that keeps coming back? You try exercising at the gym,
practising yoga, pilates or running but keep getting injured? Or maybe you feel
that things never quite got back to normal after having a baby? Are you a
curious mind, interested in learning more about how your body works and would
like to reclaim a strong body and an active lifestyle - whatever that might mean
for you?

Movement coaching could be the very thing you are looking for.

Our unique, evidence-based approach bridges the gap between physiotherapy and
strength and conditioning. It aims to help you build more balanced muscle use
patterns and more robust functional strength, so you can move with ease in
whatever modality of exercise you choose.
