  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Do you have an injury that keeps coming back? You try exercising at the gym,
running, practising yoga or Pilates but keep getting hurt? Do you have back pain
every time you lift or carry your child or grandchild? Or maybe you feel that
things never quite got back to normal post-baby? You might have tried various
approaches with mixed results but the pain keeps returning.

Are you a curious mind, interested in understanding why you get injured and
determined to step by step reclaim a strong body and an active lifestyle,
whatever that might mean for you? Precision rehab personal training could be the very thing you are looking for.

Our unique, evidence-based approach bridges the gap between physiotherapy and
strength and conditioning. Using an elite athlete coaching approach, we will
figure out together:

1. What is the problem?
2. Why did it happen?
3. What is the recovery strategy?
4. What is the timeline of recovery and return to your chosen physical activity
   (running, weight training, dance, gardening, carrying your children)?
