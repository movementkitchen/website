  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Movement Kitchen helps women 40+ with history of back pain reach their athletic goals with science-backed, body-wise training. Our 1:1 and small group coaching programs blend cutting-edge biomechanics with 13 years of women's health expertise.

Remember when you could bounce back from any workout? As our bodies evolve, the fitness strategies that worked in our 20s and 30s often need an upgrade. At Movement Kitchen, we understand that staying active while managing a demanding career and navigating the hormonal shifts of perimenopause, requires a smart, personalised training that works with your body, not against it. This is especially important, if you have a recurring injury, pain or a weakness. We need to build solid foundations and progress sustainably.

Wherever you are, we will work together to create an action plan with weekly milestones to help you reach your athletic goals.

Movement Kitchen is *LGBTQ+ friendly*. Every human is welcome, whatever their gender identity.
