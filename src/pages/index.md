  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Movement Kitchen offers an evidence-based precision training for women bridging physiotherapy and strength and conditioning - focusing on women’s musculoskeletal, pelvic and hormonal needs in a particular stage of their lives – pregnancy, postnatal period, perimenopause and menopause.

You might feel that conventional exercise is not serving you – you keep getting injured at the gym or hurt for days after training. Or maybe you live with endometriosis, back pain, pelvic organ prolapse or another chronic health condition and want to find a way how to exercise and get stronger in a way that works for you.

Maybe you are an expectant mum who is not sure how to exercise and adapt your training as your pregnancy progresses, or a postpartum mum who wants to reclaim a strong body after having a baby and return to exercise or competitive sports. Or maybe you’ve a baby years ago but feel that your core and the pelvic floor never fully recovered. 

Maybe you are going through perimenopause and want to build training a way that will help you gain muscle, increase energy levels and feel your best through the menopausal transition. Or you might be post-menopausal, looking to build strength, improve pelvic health, build strong bones and stay active for decades to come.

Working together we will create an action plan with weekly milestones to help you reach your health and fitness goals – from rehab to performance.
