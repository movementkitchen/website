      Working with Ivana has really helped me to get more in touch with my body.
      She is lovely to work with - very gentle, understanding and supportive. I
      now have much more ingrained understanding about how my body is
      functioning.

      For someone who hasn't done yoga or movement workshops before I found
      working with Ivana really useful - she was great at explaining what the
      each exercise was about. I learnt a lot and am looking forward to fixing
      my body.

      Ivana was really supportive as I went to her studio with my newborn and
      she not only helped me to better understand how to recover my diastasis,
      but even managed to calm and put my baby to sleep while explaining and
      training me.

Do you have an injury that keeps coming back? You try exercising at the gym,
practising yoga, Pilates or running but keep getting hurt? Do you have back pain
every time you lift or carry your child or grandchild? Or maybe you feel that
things never quite got back to normal after having a baby? You might have tried
various approaches with mixed results but the pain keeps returning.

Are you a curious mind, interested in understanding why you get injured and
determined to step by step reclaim a strong body and an active lifestyle,
whatever that might mean for you?

Precision rehab personal training could be the very thing you are looking for.

Our unique, evidence-based approach bridges the gap between physiotherapy and
strength and conditioning. Using an elite athlete coaching approach, we will
figure out:

1. What is the problem?
2. Why did it happen?
3. What is the recovery strategy?
4. What is the timeline of recovery and return to your chosen physical activity
   (running, weight training, dance, gardening, carrying your children)?
