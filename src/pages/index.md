    text: Working with Ivana has really helped me to get more in touch with my body. She is lovely to work with - very gentle, understanding and supportive. She obviously knows a huge amount about her subjects too, and draws from many areas to work in a way that suited me, whether biomechanics, yoga, mindfulness or massage, which is wonderful. After only a few sessions I now have much more ingrained understanding about how my body is functioning and would strongly recommend working with her.

    text: Fantastic first class with Ivana. For someone who hasn't done yoga or movement workshops before I found working with Ivana really useful - she was great at explaining what the each exercise was about. I learnt a lot and am looking forward to fixing my body. Thank you Ivana!

    text: I met Ivana for one-to-one movement coaching session and I left her studio with lots of new knowledge, experience, a book recommendation, and exercises to do at home. Ivana was really supportive as I went to her studio with my newborn and she not only helped me to better understand how to recover my diastasis, but even managed to calm and put my baby to sleep while explaining and training me.
