  text: After 10 years of chronic pain, dizziness, headaches, bad mood, money wasted on different doctors, therapies, exercises… I tried it all… I can finally live my life like a normal person. This experience helped me reconnect with my body, be pain free, learn how to move freely and maintain my wellbeing. In just 2 weeks all my symptoms were gone and I was able to trust my body again and rebuild my strength.

  text: Ivana has been a beam of hope for me. I was really considering surgery. I'm so glad that I found her because through her coaching I have learnt so much about the feet and their connections through the legs and pelvic floor. Everything aligns. I've noticed such an improvement that I don't have to buy tops which are a size bigger to fit my belly. I also feel stronger and reconnected to my core, now I know how it works and my awareness is better.

  text: I started working with Ivana after seeing the amazing progress my husband has being experiencing with her. I initially sought help for my back pain, and I have been consistently impressed with the results over the past few months. Not only has my back pain improved, but I've also noticed a significant increase in my overall well-being.

### Do you keep tweaking your back at the gym or in fitness classes?

You've tried physiotherapy. Yoga. Pilates. Core strengthening. Maybe they helped temporarily, but the pain always returns. You wonder if you're broken or doing exercises wrong. Or maybe back pain is normal as we get older?

Well, I though so too at the age of 29, when my neurologist explained that the nerves in my lower back were permanently damaged and I would need to accept to live with pain. My lower back and shoulders were always sore and I couldn't feel the front of my left foot. 

### Fast forward to my mid 40s, I don't suffer with back pain anymore. I'm a mum of two, in perimenopause, and I lift weights.

I'm Ivana, a 46-year-old biomechanics scientist, back pain to performance specialist. I am passionate about women's health and performance (both biological and athletic) and have published research on [slowing down ageing with high levels of training](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I've created rePower Method based on the 13+ years of experience coaching people with recurring back pain and those whose bodies wouldn't respond to training. It's a 3-phase system designed to help you move from back pain to performance-based training. Challenging the body with kindness, always.
