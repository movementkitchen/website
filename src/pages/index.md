Improving how the parts of your body work together and in relation to each other can help heal and prevent injuries. Moving more sustainably will bring different outcomes on cellular level, such as better bone density, less wear and tear on the joints, and generally a more balanced strength and improved biological performance. 

Movement Kitchen brings together modern science approaches to body and movement grounded in biomechanics, physics and human kinetics with mindfulness, contemporary pilates and yoga as therapy.

The focus is on building functional, real-life strength, optimising for a body that works.
