  text: After 10 years of chronic pain, dizziness, headaches, bad mood, money waisted on different doctors, therapies, exercises… I tried it all… I can finally live my life like a normal person. This experience helped me reconnect with my body, be pain free, learn how to move freely and maintain my wellbeing. In just 2 weeks all my symptoms were gone and I was able to trust my body again and rebuild my strength.

  text: Ivana has been a beam of hope for me. I was really considering surgery. I'm so glad that I found her because through her coaching I have learnt so much about the feet and their connections through the legs and pelvic floor. Everything aligns. I've noticed such an improvement that I don't have to buy tops which are a size bigger to fit my belly. I also feel stronger and reconnected to my core, now I know how it works and my awareness is better.

  text: I started working with Ivana after seeing the amazing progress my husband has being experiencing with her. I initially sought help for my back pain, and I have been consistently impressed with the results over the past few months. Not only has my back pain improved, but I've also noticed a significant increase in my overall well-being.

Movement Kitchen helps women 40+ with history of back pain reach their athletic goals with science-backed, body-wise training. Our 1:1 and small group coaching programs blend cutting-edge biomechanics with 13 years of women's health expertise.

### Remember when you could bounce back from any workout? 

In our 40s and beyond, the fitness strategies that worked in our 20s and 30s often need an upgrade. At Movement Kitchen, we understand that staying active and pushing your physical boundaries while managing a demanding career and navigating the hormonal shifts of perimenopause, requires smart, personalised training. This is especially important, if you have a recurring injury, pain or a weakness. We need to build solid foundations and progress your training sustainably, working with your body, not against it.

Using the rePower Method, we will work together to meet you where you are, and build up from managing back pain to getting in the best shape of your life and moving like an athlete, for the decades ahead.

Movement Kitchen is *LGBTQ+ friendly*. Every human is welcome, whatever their gender identity.
