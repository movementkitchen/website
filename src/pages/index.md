  text: After five sessions with Ivana I am moving better and breathing better. I feel better! I can feel my body's limits and its tensions. This means when I take a yoga or pilates class I know how to avoid pushing my body too far towards injury and strain. I have a deeper understanding of and respect for my body.

  text: Ivana has been so helpful in the process of regaining strength in the muscles my brain had forgotten and abandoned through years of habitual movements, and releasing those which were overworked. I am now much more aware of my body, the position and movement of my pelvis, and how much difference a small adjustment can make to how I feel.

  text: Through challenging but accessible and well explained exercises I was able to understand different mechanics and healing in a new way. As much as a physical practice our time together was also incredibly educational and I have multiple take-aways I can apply in my life as I move forward.

Are you a new (or not so new) mum who feels that things have never quite got back to normal after the baby? You crave an active lifestyle but you feel your body can not quite support you? Your belly might feel weak and protruded. Or maybe you leak when you cough, run or jump. 

Or maybe you've never been pregnant, but you have a back, hip or pelvic pain that keeps coming back whenever you exercise, carry your groceries or lift something heavy. You have tried various types of therapy and training, but the symptoms keep returning.

Are you a curious mind, interested in looking deeper into what might be causing your symptoms and determined to rebuild your strength and get back to an active lifestyle?

Movement Kitchen bridges the gap between physiotherapy and strength and conditioning for women, bringing an athlete-level rehabilitation to any woman, through pregnancy, postnatal period, perimenopause and menopause. Rather than a one-off fix for your symptoms, we offer a personalised rehabilitation programme. 

We will work together to create a strategy and a realistic timeline of your return to the activities you love. Step by step, you can go back to jumping on a trampoline without leaking, running a marathon after the baby, lifting weights, going to yoga/Pilates, carrying children, skiing, surfing, climbing or whatever matters to you. My task is to break this goal into smaller achievable ones.
