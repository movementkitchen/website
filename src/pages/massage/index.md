### Balinese massage

Balinese massage helps to improve blood circulation and break sticky points in your connective tissue, but it’s also a beautifully indulging experience reviving the magic of Hindu rituals and celebrating unconditional love through touch. Smoothly weaving together various techniques of both Eastern and Western bodywork including Shiatsu, Lomi Lomi, deep tissue massage, reflexology and acupressure it allows you to dive into a whole new language of touch, pressure, breath and rhythm. I like to combine it with elements of mindfulness of the body and Yoga Nidra (yoga of sleep) - exploring nurturing states of deep rest. 

Price:  
£50 for 30 minutes or  
£100 for 1 hour of a luxurious full body massage
