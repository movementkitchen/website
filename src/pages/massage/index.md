### Balinese massage

Balinese massage helps to improve blood circulation and break sticky points in
your connective tissue, but it’s also a beautifully indulging experience
reviving the magic of Hindu rituals and celebrating unconditional love through
touch. Smoothly weaving together various techniques of both Eastern and Western
bodywork including Shiatsu, Lomi Lomi, deep tissue massage, reflexology and
acupressure it allows you to dive into a whole new language of touch, pressure,
breath and rhythm. I like to combine it with elements of mindfulness of the body
and yoga nidra (yoga of sleep) - exploring nurturing states of deep rest.

Price:  
£50 for 60 minutes (includes massage + guided deep relaxation/yoga nidra)
