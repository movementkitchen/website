### About Ivana

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and finding ways to heal
them. I often felt my body was too fragile to follow my pace of life. In 2008 I
left a career in corporate law with a recurrent back pain and not being able to
feel parts of my left foot. I completed my first yoga teacher training with the
Yoga Federation of Serbia back in my home country. In 2012 I continued my yoga
studies in India, spending three months at the Yoga Institute Santacruz in
Mumbai and volunteering at health camps and workshops that the Institute
regularly held for the locals. Coming back to England, I went on studying with
Yogacampus and attending intensives and immersions in London primarily focusing
on yoga as therapy. After years of studying, teaching and a dedicated daily
practice I managed to fully restore my feet and rarely had any back pain.

But then in 2014, shortly after my first child was born, I suffered a repetitive
strain injury of both wrists and a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti)
with recurring back spasms that made me unable to continue my practice the way
it was. It was so incredibly frustrating to be getting re-injured over and over
again and have spasms every time I practised yoga, or even just carried my
child. Not moving couldn't be an option, but the way I used to move was hurting
me.

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and very
little research done about diastasis recti, especially about its connection with
back and pelvic pain. Abdominal separation is usually seen as an "aesthetic
problem" and most of the solutions available focused on patching the gap instead
of looking into what had caused it in the first place.

> I wanted to understand why injuries happen and how to avoid them in the first
> place.

Looking for answers I started obsessively learning different approaches to
movement and bodywork. Questioning, deconstructing and learning again from
various teachers across the fields of yoga as therapy, pilates, somatics, dance,
Structural Integration, myofascial release and massage.

In 2014 I discovered the work of American biomechanics scientist Katy Bowman
looking into forces of physics created by movement and how gravity, pressure and
friction affect tissues. I felt I finally found a missing piece I was looking
for. I wanted to learn how to think and see the body as a biomechanist and above
all, to understand what had contributed to my injury in the first place and see
if I could heal the separation without a surgery. In 2015 I started the 2-year
certification with the Nutritious Movement Institute under Katy Bowman and in
October 2017 got qualified as a Nutritious Movementâ„¢ certified Restorative
Exercise Specialist.

These two years felt like peeling off layer by layer of all I knew about
movement, rebuilding and reconnecting everything again. I quickly gave up on the
surgery idea and instead of focussing on the separation itself I started
focussing on restoring the functionality of everything around it. I realised
that challenge for me was not to just move more but with more precision, getting
more parts of my body to actively participate in the movement. I started
focusing more on motor programming and proprioception in my movement practice,
isolating small movements and mastering them before jumping onto larger ones.
And gradually I have restored a functional core and a body that is able to
support me in doing what I love.

Rebuilding confidence into what my body was able to do brought about a
transition to a much more movement-rich lifestyle. I threw out the supportive
insoles from my shoes and gradually replaced all my heeled shoes with barefoot
ones, our family got rid of most of our furniture and started spending a lot of
our time outside, moving in nature. I started looking at my environment
differently, finding movement opportunities where there were none: noticing all
the trees for climbing on my walks, walking much more barefoot and on varied
surfaces, using the children playground time to hang, climb and play with them
instead of just standing around.

Exercise is not enough - I realised, we need MOVEMENT to thrive. Our bodies are
beautifully malleable and adapt to the way we use them.

> Not just exercise, but everything we do is an input.

You can create an environment that requires you to move more frequently and move
more parts of you as you go about your everyday life. Even making tiny changes
can make a big difference over time. Each little change creates a thousand
ripples.

### About Movement Kitchen

I love kitchens. Kitchen is always a place where magic happens. A source of
physical, mental and spiritual sustenance. Kitchen makes a home homely. It's a
place where no make up and bedhead are always fine. A place of getting the hands
dirty, playing and experimentation. A place of connecting to your intuition,
following the gut.

> Movement kitchen for me symbolises weaving movement into the everyday life,
> living in a way that movement becomes a part of your identity.

My studio really happens to be in our large open-plan kitchen and the living
room. When I don't teach here our living space is still full of exercise props
(e.g. half domes, balance boards, spiky balls and resistance bands) lying around
and me and the children playing with them here and there as I'm trying to cook
dinner. I chose the name Movement Kitchen to reflect the warm, homely, intimate
atmosphere of a kitchen I try to create working with people. In some way, my
movement coaching sessions are similar to inviting someone for dinner and ending
up cooking together, playfully mixing spices into a tasty nurturing meal. I work
a lot with biomechanics and science of movement but in a relaxed and informal
way, guided by empathy and intuition. Instead of a lab my working space is a
kitchen, both literally and metaphorically.
