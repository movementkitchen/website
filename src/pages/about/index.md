Movement coaching aims to help you overcome injuries and develop more
sustainable movement patterns in your exercise routines and daily life -
optimising for better biological performance and long-term health.

We will try to identify movements that could be injuring you, look into your
alignment (positioning of your body in use), assess your joint angles and muscle
use strategies and test your motor control in different functional movements.

A lot of our work focuses on the nervous system and motor programming. You will
learn how to isolate and control small movements, safely building towards more
complex and more physically demanding movements.

The aim of the exercises is not to challenge your abilities, but build new
neural pathways - innervating underused areas of the body so they would
gradually restore their function in your day-to-day life. The exercises are
performed slowly and with as little effort as possible and ideally, integrated
into your non-exercise time. Gradually, your body will adopt the new motor
skills and they will become a part of your regular movement vocabulary.

### About Movement Kitchen

The name Movement Kitchen for me symbolises weaving movement into the everyday.
My studio really happens to be in our large open-plan kitchen. When I don't
teach here our living space is still an ever‐changing obstacle course with
balance boards, half domes and spiky balls lying around and me and the children
playfully climbing over them as I'm trying to cook dinner.

I aim to create the warm, homely, intimate atmosphere of the kitchen in my
sessions too. I work a lot with biomechanics and science of movement but in a
relaxed and informal way, guided by empathy and intuition. Instead of a lab my
working space is a kitchen, both literally and metaphorically.

### About Ivana

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge
for learning in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too
fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008 I left a career in corporate law with recurrent back and shoulder pain
and not being able to feel parts of my left foot. I found that yoga was helping
me, so, geeky and thorough as I was, I went to study yoga. I completed my first
200 hour yoga teacher training with the Yoga Federation of Serbia, back in my
home country. In 2012 I continued my yoga studies at the Yoga Institute
Santacruz in Mumbai, India focussing on the therapeutic aspects of yoga. I spent
three months living and studying full time (900 hours) at the Institute,
assisting and teaching at health camps and workshops that the Institute
regularly held for the locals. Back in the UK, I continued studying with
Yogacampus in London. After years of learning, teaching and a dedicated daily
practice I managed to fully restore my feet and rarely had any back pain.

But then in 2014, shortly after my first child was born, I suffered a severe
abdominal separation - diastasis recti and De Quervain's tendinosis on both
wrists. After the birth of my second child - in 2015, my core was completely
destroyed. The recurring back spasms made me unable to continue my practice the
way it was. It was so incredibly frustrating to be re-injured over and over
again and in pain after every time I practised yoga or even just carried my
baby. Not moving couldn't be an option, but the way I used to move was hurting
me.

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and very
little research done about diastasis recti, especially about its connection with
back and pelvic pain and disfunction. Abdominal separation is usually seen as a
cosmetic problem and most of the solutions available focused on patching the gap
instead of looking into what had caused it.

Looking for answers I started obsessively researching and learning different
approaches to movement and bodywork. Questioning, deconstructing and learning
again from various teachers across the fields of yoga, pilates, somatics,
movement and dance therapy, Structural Integration, myofascial release and
massage.

In 2015 I discovered the work of biomechanist and researcher Katy Bowman looking
into loads and forces of physics created by movement. I felt I finally found a
missing piece I was looking for in my journey to heal the abdominal separation
without a surgery. I started the 2-year certification with Katy Bowman's
Nutritious Movement Institute and in October 2017 got qualified as a Nutritious
Movement™ certified Restorative Exercise Specialist. Studying biomechanics and
science of movement felt like peeling off layer by layer of all I knew about
movement, rebuilding and reconnecting everything again. I quickly gave up on the
surgery idea and instead of focussing on the separation itself I started
focussing on restoring the functionality of everything around it. And gradually
I have restored a strong, working core and a body that is able to support me in
doing what I love.

Trying to make my skills more useful to women who are looking to improve their
quality of life after pregnancy and childbirth, I am currently studying Advanced
CPD in Modern Post Natal Assessment, Core Restore & Functional Exercise
Programming with Jenny Burrell. My passion for movement and fascination with the
body keeps driving me to learn, research and explore new approaches and tools
across the fields of functional movement, physiotherapy, fitness and soft tissue
therapy.

And my personal journey towards a more movement-rich lifestyle continues. Over
the last five years I've thrown out all the supportive insoles from my shoes and
gradually replaced the heeled shoes with wide and flexible minimal ones. Our
family got rid of most of our furniture and equipped our house with a climbing
frame and a plenty of unstable surfaces instead. We started spending a lot of
our time outside, moving in nature. I started looking at my environment
differently, finding movement opportunities where there were none: noticing all
the trees for climbing on my walks, walking much more barefoot and on varied
surfaces, using the children playground time to hang, climb and play with them
instead of just standing around.

Exercise is not enough - I realised, we need MOVEMENT to thrive. Our bodies are
beautifully malleable and adapt to the way we use them. You can create an
environment that requires you to move more frequently and move more parts of you
as you go about your everyday life. Each little change creates a thousand
ripples.
