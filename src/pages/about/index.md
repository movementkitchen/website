### About

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist, coach and therapist. I am passionate about women's health, ageing and mechanisms of injuries and have published [research on ageing elite endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I'm also a mum of two (born by a C-section and a home birth after a caesarean (HBAC)) with a lived experience of severe diastasis recti and chronic back pain.

Movement Kitchen evolved through 12 years of my work with movement and rehabilitation as a precision training for women who want to reclaim an active lifestyle through different life stages - especially in cases where it's not straightforward to train.

Many people who would come to see me had found themselves bouncing back and forth between physiotherapy and the gym – getting the all-clear from the physio and going back to training just to get injured and back to physiotherapy, again and again. This is why I developed an approach with one foot in rehabilitation and another in strength and conditioning. 

I see kitchen as a feminine, nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen – with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I strive to create the safe and intimate atmosphere of a kitchen in my sessions too. My approach is based on research and clinical practice but guided by empathy and intuition. I aim to build a supportive environment for you to get to know and work with your body towards reaching your optimum fitness and performance level.
