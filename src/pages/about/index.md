### About me

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist, coach and therapist with over a decade of experience supporting women through pregnancy, postnatal recovery and menopause. I have a special interest in mechanisms of injuries, ageing, and women's health and have published [research on ageing elite endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I’m passionate about bringing elite-athlete-level of care to everyday mums who could never afford a team of experts standing behind them. I'm also a mum of two (born by a C-section and a homebirth after cesaerean) with a lived experience of overcoming a severe diastasis recti and chronic back pain. When I don't research, teach or write, you can usually find me drawing in Walthamstow Marshes with my 7- and 9-year-olds.

### About Movement Kitchen

The name Movement Kitchen stands for weaving movement into the everyday, reclaiming the right to move your body on your own terms, in your own space. Kitchen is a feminine and nurturing environment, with hardly any overlaps with the tough, no-pain-no-gain culture of sport and exercise. It's a space for creating - intentionally and serendipitously, for playing and trying things out. Anything is allowed in the kitchen, no make-up required, no dress code, no body image obsession. You can relax and be you.

My studio really is a kitchen. With large floor to ceiling mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I try to recreate the safe and intimate atmosphere of a kitchen in my sessions too. My approach is based on research and clinical practice but guided by empathy and intuition. It offers a supportive environment for you to get to know your body and its capabilities, and develop a nourishing long-term relationship with exercise.
