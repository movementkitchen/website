Hi there! I'm Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist and a coach passionate about women's health and biological performance - read: how to make our bodies function at their best through different stages of our lives. I love researching, writing and geeking out about healthy pelvises, bellies and pressure inside them.   

Another half of my passion is longevity. I published research on [elite master endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/) who practically slowed down ageing with high levels of training. Yes, a good part of what we think of as 'ageing' is detraining and an adaptation to inactivity - so, totally avoidable!

Over the years, I've specialised in working with people stuck in a loop between physiotherapy and the gym, people who don't seem to 'bounce back' after pregnancy and childbirth, people with mysterious 'women's health issues', people with recurring back pain and those who feel that their bodies don't respond well to conventional approaches to exercise.

I was there once (or twice) myself. First time, as a desk-bound young professional in my 20s with chronic lower back pain and a half of my left foot completely numb. Second time, as a mum of two in my mid-30s with a weak, disconnected belly 2 clothing sizes up compared to the rest of my body, sneeze pee and my lower back in spasm every time I would open a heavy door.

Being on the autistic spectrum, my way of dealing with problems is to throw a lot of learning at them. To dig and dig deep.

So, on the way to get my body stronger and break out of the weakness and re-injury cycle, I learnt from many exceptional physiotherapists, sports, exercise, movement and bodywork professionals, completed over 1200 hours of training in yoga therapy, Pilates, corrective exercise and massage and eventually did a master's in sports science - biomechanics - digging into loads and forces behind movements and mechanisms of injuries.

### My Approach

I developed the Core rePower method through 12+ years of my professional and personal journey, integrating everything I learnt into a unique approach.

Many people who would come to see me had found themselves bouncing back and forth between physiotherapy and the gym – getting the all-clear from the physio and going back to training just to get injured and back to physiotherapy, again and again. This is why I developed an approach that seemlesly connects rehabilitation and strength and conditioning training.

Each Core rePower journey includes five stages:

1. *RELEASE* - releasing muscle tension, relieving pain
2. *RECONNECT* - reconnecting muscles to the brain, restoring reflexes
3. *REBUILD* - building muscle, learning to manage pressure and stabilise joints in dynamic workouts
4. *REPOWER* - progressive overload, increasing pressure tolerance
5. *REINFORCE* - injury-proofing the core,  training in vulnerable positions.

### Why Movement Kitchen?

I see kitchen as a nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen – with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I aim to recreate the safe and nourishing atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions too, offering a supportive space for you to get to know your body and get stronger on your own terms.

I value evidence-based solutions and precise, focused training where everything has its 'why', but my coaching style is grounded in empathy and non-violence – challenging the body with kindness.
