### About me

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist, coach and writer with over a decade of experience supporting women through pregnancy, postnatal recovery and menopause. I have a special interest in mechanisms of injuries, ageing, and women's health and have published [research on ageing elite endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I’m passionate about bringing elite-athlete-level of care to any mum. I'm also a mum of two (born by a C-section and a homebirth after cesaerean) with a lived experience of overcoming a severe diastasis recti and chronic back pain. When I don't research, teach or write, you can usually find me drawing in Walthamstow Marshes with my 7- and 9-year-olds.

### About Movement Kitchen

Kitchen is a feminine and nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen. With large floor to ceiling mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I try to recreate the safe and intimate atmosphere of a kitchen in my sessions too. My approach is based on research and clinical practice but guided by empathy and intuition. It offers a supportive environment for you to get to know your body and its capabilities, and develop a nourishing long-term relationship with exercise.
