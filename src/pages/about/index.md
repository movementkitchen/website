Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist, coach and therapist. I am passionate about women's health, ageing and core rehab and have published [research on ageing elite endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I'm also a mum of two, born by a C-section and a home birth after a caesarean (HBAC) with a lived experience of severe diastasis recti and chronic back pain (scroll all the way down to read my story).

Feel free to get in touch with any questions or collaaboration suggestions or just to say hi. I'm always open for new ideas!

Love and muscles,

### My Approach

Movement Kitchen evolved through 12 years of my work with movement and rehabilitation as a precision training for women who want to get stronger when it's not straightforward to train.

Many people who would come to see me had found themselves bouncing back and forth between physiotherapy and the gym – getting the all-clear from the physio and going back to training just to get injured and back to physiotherapy, again and again. This is why I developed an approach with one foot in rehabilitation and another in strength and conditioning. 

I see kitchen as a nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen – with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I aim to recreate the safe and nourishing atmosphere of a kitchen in my sessions too. My approach is based on research and clinical practice but guided by empathy and intuition. I strive to create a supportive space for you to get to know your body and get stronger on your own terms.

### My Story

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge to learn in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008, I left a career in corporate law with recurrent back and shoulder pain and no sensation in half of my left foot. I found that yoga was helping my back, so I went on to study yoga. I completed 1000+ hours of yoga teacher training in Serbia, my home country, India and the UK, focusing on yoga therapy. After years of learning, teaching and dedicated daily practice I restored sensation in my whole left foot, had no back pain and even managed to grow 1.5 cm! Specialising in teaching pregnancy and postpartum yoga classes allowed me to continue teaching yoga throughout my both pregnancies and the births of my children. 

My first baby was born in 2013, by an emergency C-section that left me feeling weak and defeated. In the first days after the surgery, I could not straighten up to standing, but luckily, the scar healed well. After the routine 6-week postpartum check-up I got a green light for returning to exercise. So, I went straight back to teaching yoga and shortly after, took up teaching the advanced level at the gym. 

I might have been around two months postpartum when, after demonstrating the "wild thing" - a pose that combines an inversion, twist and backband – I found myself with a fist-width hole in the connective tissue running across my midline. My linea alba was literally gone in that whole area. The belly was bulging and deforming at movements that used to be easy. It turned out I had a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti). 

For things to be even sadder, I've also gradually developed De Quervain's tendinosis ("mother's wrist") on both my wrists and could not bear weight on my arms. It was incredibly frustrating to get re-injured and in pain every time I exercised or carried my baby. 

> It struck me how many postnatal issues you never ever hear about until you are unlucky to get them.

I spent 1.5 years being able to practise only very gentle pregnancy yoga. I visited numerous physios who had no idea how to help me. And then I got pregnant again. My second child was born in 2015, this time naturally, at home, but I had a 2nd-degree tear, lost a lot of blood and my abdominal separation was now around 6 fingers wide. Even at 1 year postpartum I felt weak and looked 5 months pregnant - a shopkeeper in a local grocery shop congratulated me on already being pregnant with the third child. 

I was wondering if I would ever be able to practise anything but extremely gentle low-impact exercise. Doing even a simple sun salutation or dynamic lunges would leave me with back and hip spasms for days. 

I found that there was little support offered by the healthcare and very little published research on diastasis recti, especially its connection with back and pelvic pain and dysfunction. I couldn’t find a single physiotherapist who had an experience with diastasis recti. The separation was seen as a cosmetic problem and most of the solutions focused on patching the gap instead of looking into what had caused it. 

> I couldn’t help wondering: if diastasis recti is just an aesthetic issue, why do I need a painkiller to sleep?

Feeling lost and unsupported by healthcare, I studied across various disciplines to be able to manage my symptoms and continue to move and teach. I searched for answers across yoga, Pilates, soft tissue therapy, corrective exercise, sport science and medicine, physiotherapy and women's health. Digging deeper and deeper eventually brought me to a master's degree in sports science, focusing on biomechanics and mechanisms of injuries.

I realised that diastasis recti was not a problem in itself, but a symptom of my poor intra-abdominal pressure management that would have sooner or later led to an injury. If it wasn't diastasis it would have maybe been a slipped disc in my spine, or a hernia, or a pelvic organ prolapse. I needed to learn how to use the pressure inside my belly effectively. This meant, first, I needed to go back to breathing and build back up from there.

I started from retraining my diaphragm, pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles, restoring the mobility of my pelvis and the ribs. I learnt how to manage the pressure inside my belly when I move and then gradually added weight and built muscles to support me. Over time, I managed to restore a functional core and get stronger and more resilient than in my twenties.

Alongside my personal journey, I've worked with many women trapped in the cracks of an exercise culture that doesn't understand nor prioritise women's needs. I got fascinated by female athletes' postpartum return to sport, especially, training with diastasis recti, prolapse, hernias, incontinence and other pressure management issues.

I am passionate about using my knowlegde and personal experience to support people in reclaiming strong bodies that could support them in everything they want to do, from lifting their children to paddleboarding, weightlifting, rock climbing, surfing, skiing or running a marathon.
