### About

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports and exercise scientist with a Master's degree in Biomechanics and over a decade of experience working with movement and rehabilitation. I have a special interest in mechanisms of injuries, ageing, and women's health and have published [research on ageing master endurance athletes](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I’m passionate about using the learning from elite athletes to improve quality of life of everyday people, especially mums. When I don't research or coach, you can usually find me singing on the 
bicycle or drawing in Walthamstow Marshes with my 7- and 9-year olds. 

### My Story

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge
for learning in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too
fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008 I left a career in corporate law with recurrent back and shoulder pain
and not being able to feel parts of my left foot. I found that yoga was helping
me, so, I went to study yoga. I completed my first 200-hour yoga teacher training in 2011 with the Yoga Federation of Serbia, back in my home country. In 2012 I continued my yoga studies at the Yoga Institute Santacruz in Mumbai, India, focussing on yoga therapy. I spent
three months living and studying full time (900 hours) at the Institute,
assisting and teaching at health camps and workshops that the Institute
regularly held for the locals. Back in the UK, I continued studying with
Yogacampus in London. After years of learning, teaching and a dedicated daily
practice I managed to fully restore my feet and rarely had any back pain. 

I specialised in teaching pregnancy and postpartum yoga classes, which allowed me to continue teaching throughout my both pregnancies and the births of my children in 2013 and 2015. But shortly after my first child was born, I suffered a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti) and De Quervain's tendinosis on both wrists. After the birth of my second child, my core was completely destroyed. The recurring lower back spasms made it impossible to continue my practice the way it was. It was incredibly frustrating to get re-injured and in pain every time I practised yoga or carried my baby.

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and little research done about diastasis recti, especially its connection with
back and pelvic pain and disfunction. Abdominal separation was usually seen as a
cosmetic problem and most of the solutions focused on patching the gap
instead of looking into what had caused it.

Looking for answers I started researching and learning different modalities of therapeutic movement and bodywork. Questioning and deconstructing I studied across the fields of yoga, Pilates, somatics, massage, exercise science, physiotherapy and women's health. In 2017, I completed a two-year training as a Personal Trainer Restorative Exercise Specialist. Rather than teaching groups, I started focusing on one-to-one movement coaching to help people get out of the patterns of recurring injuries. Yoga with Ivana gradually became Movement Kitchen. Trying to understand mechanisms of injuries and how to prevent them brought me to a MSc in Biomechanics / Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Roehampton. I graduated in January 2021 with distinction. 

Over the years, I have managed to restore my core and get stronger and more resilient than in my twenties, but my personal movement journey continues. I've gradually removed the supportive insoles from my shoes and replaced the heeled shoes with wide and flexible minimal ones. Our family got rid of most of our furniture and equipped our house with a climbing frame instead of a TV. We started spending a lot of our time outside, moving in nature. Longer I work with movement and the body, more I realise, the progress is defined not by one-time achievements, but by general blurring of the border between exercise and the rest of our lives.

### About Movement Kitchen

The name Movement Kitchen for me symbolises weaving movement into the everyday.
My studio really happens to be in our large open-plan kitchen. When I don't
teach here our living space is still an ever‐changing obstacle course with
balance boards, half domes and spiky balls lying around and me and the children
playfully climbing over them as I'm trying to cook dinner.

I aim to create the homely, intimate atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions
too. I work a lot with biomechanics and science of movement but in a relaxed and
informal way, guided by empathy and intuition. Instead of a lab my working space
is a kitchen, both literally and metaphorically.
