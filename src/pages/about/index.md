### About Movement Kitchen

My studio really happens to be in our large open-plan kitchen. When I don't
teach here our living space is still full of exercise props (e.g. half domes,
balance boards, spiky balls and resistance bands) lying around and me and the
children playing with them here and there as I'm trying to cook dinner.

I use [Restorative Exercise / Nutritious Movement™][1] approach as a starting
point in my work looking for movement equivalents of nutritional deficiencies in
the body - undermoved areas and underused muscles, joints that hardly articulate
and motor skills that are lacking. The idea is to initially supplement your
movement diet with precisely targeted exercises to restore function in the
underused areas and then really get to use them more in your day-to-day life. In
a way, the exercises are used as vitamins - to address the nutritional issue in
a short term while gradually transitioning to a more varied and nutrient-rich
diet that will help the body thrive in a long run.

I aim to create the warm, homely, intimate atmosphere of the kitchen in my
sessions too. In some way, my movement coaching sessions are similar to inviting
someone for dinner and ending up cooking together, playfully mixing spices into
a tasty, nurturing meal.

I work a lot with biomechanics and science of movement but in a relaxed and
informal way, guided by empathy and intuition. Instead of a lab my working space
is a kitchen, both literally and metaphorically.

### About Ivana

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge
for learning in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too
fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008 I left a career in corporate law with a recurrent back pain and not
being able to feel parts of my left foot. I completed my first yoga teacher
training with the Yoga Federation of Serbia back in my home country. In 2012 I
continued my yoga studies in India, spending three months at the Yoga Institute
Santacruz in Mumbai and volunteering at health camps and workshops that the
Institute regularly held for the locals. Coming back to England, I went on
studying with Yogacampus and attending intensives and immersions in London
primarily focusing on yoga as therapy. After years of studying, teaching and a
dedicated daily practice I managed to fully restore my feet and rarely had any
back pain.

But then in 2014, shortly after my first child was born, I suffered a repetitive
strain injury of both wrists and a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti)
with recurring back spasms that made me unable to continue my practice the way
it was. It was so incredibly frustrating to be getting re-injured over and over
again and have spasms every time I practised yoga, or even just carried my
child. Not moving couldn't be an option, but the way I used to move was hurting
me.

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and very
little research done about diastasis recti, especially about its connection with
back and pelvic pain. Abdominal separation is usually seen as an "aesthetic
problem" and most of the solutions available focused on patching the gap instead
of looking into what had caused it.

> place

Looking for answers I started obsessively learning different approaches to
movement and bodywork. Questioning, deconstructing and learning again from
various teachers across the fields of yoga as therapy, pilates, somatics, dance,
Structural Integration, myofascial release and massage.

In 2014 I discovered the work of American biomechanics scientist Katy Bowman
looking into forces of physics created by movement and how gravity, pressure and
friction affect tissues. I felt I finally found a missing piece I was looking
for. I wanted to learn how to think and see the body as a biomechanist. But
above all, I wanted to find the underlying causes of my injury and see if I
could heal the separation without a surgery. In 2015 I started the 2-year
certification with the Nutritious Movement Institute under Katy Bowman and in
October 2017 got qualified as a Nutritious Movement™ certified Restorative
Exercise Specialist.

These two years felt like peeling off layer by layer of all I knew about
movement, rebuilding and reconnecting everything again. I quickly gave up on the
surgery idea and instead of focussing on the separation itself I started
focussing on restoring the functionality of everything around it. I realised
that challenge for me was not to just move more but with more precision, getting
more parts of my body to actively participate in the movement. I started
focusing more on motor programming and proprioception in my movement practice,
isolating small movements and mastering them before jumping onto larger ones.
And gradually I have restored a functional core and a body that is able to
support me in doing what I love.

Rebuilding confidence into what my body was able to do brought about a
transition to a much more movement-rich lifestyle. I threw out the supportive
insoles from my shoes and gradually replaced all my heeled shoes with barefoot
ones. Our family got rid of most of our furniture and started spending a lot of
our time outside, moving in nature. I started looking at my environment
differently, finding movement opportunities where there were none: noticing all
the trees for climbing on my walks, walking much more barefoot and on varied
surfaces, using the children playground time to hang, climb and play with them
instead of just standing around.

> defined not by one time achievements, but by general blurring of the border

Exercise is not enough - I realised, we need MOVEMENT to thrive. Our bodies are
beautifully malleable and adapt to the way we use them.

You can create an environment that requires you to move more frequently and move
more parts of you as you go about your everyday life. Even making tiny changes
can make a big difference over time. Each little change creates a thousand
ripples.
