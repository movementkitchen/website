### About

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports and exercise scientist with a Master's degree in Biomechanics and over a decade of experience working with movement and rehabilitation. I have a special interest in mechanisms of injuries, ageing, and women's health and have published [research on ageing master endurance athletes](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I’m passionate about using the learning from elite athletes to improve quality of life of everyday people, especially mums. When I don't research or coach, you can usually find me singing on the bicycle or drawing in Walthamstow Marshes with my 7- and 9-year olds.
