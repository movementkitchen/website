Hi there! I'm Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist and holistic strength coach with 13 years of experience working in health and fitness. I am passionate about women's athletic and biological performance - read: how to make our bodies function at their best through different stages of our lives. I love researching, writing and geeking out about healthy backs, pelvises, bellies and pressure inside them.   

Another half of my passion is longevity. I published research on [elite master endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/) who practically slowed down ageing with high levels of training. Yes, a good part of what we think of as 'ageing' is detraining and an adaptation to inactivity - so, totally avoidable!

I value evidence-based solutions and precise, focused training where everything has its ‘why’. My coaching style is grounded in empathy and non-violence – challenging the body with kindness.

### I never though I would be the strongest and fittest in my life at the age of 45!

The rePower Method developed over the 13 years of my personal struggle with lower back pain and a difficult postpartum recovery.

Solving a puzzle of my pain and the weak, unresponsive belly, I spent years learning everything I could across the fields of movement, physiotherapy, sports and exercise science, and women's health. I was lucky to learn from and coach many incredible people along the way. I got fascinated with biological and athletic performance, which brought me to my second master's degree, in sports and exercise biomechanics. 

Eventually, my approach crystallised into my signature method rePower, seamlessly connecting physiotherapy with strength & conditioning training.

Each rePower journey includes three stages:

1. *RESTORE* - managing pain flare-ups, building core stability foundations
2. *REBUILD* - increasing muscle mass, core stability in dynamic workouts with added weights/resistance, progressive overload
3. *REINFORCE* - performance-based, sport-specific training, pushing your boundaries, injury-proofing the body

### Why Movement Kitchen?

I see kitchen as a nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen – with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I aim to recreate the safe and nourishing atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions too, offering a supportive space for you to get to know your body and get stronger on your own terms.
