### About Movement Kitchen

Kitchen is where magic happens. A source of physical, mental and spiritual
sustenance. Kitchen makes a home homely. It's a place of rekindling the joy of
play, enjoying the process of making, getting the hands dirty. A place of
connecting to our intuition, our inner wisdom, following the gut.

I want you to experience our movement practice as a kitchen, not a lab. Equally
about the process as it is about the result. Creating a safe and playful
environment for inquiry and exploration through movement. There is no right and
wrong, but just exploring different ways of moving that might serve your body
better.

### About Ivana

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and finding ways to heal
them. I often felt my body was too fragile to follow my pace of life. In 2008 I
left a career in corporate law with a recurrent back pain and not being able to
feel parts of my left foot. I completed my first 200 hour yoga teacher training
with the Yoga Federation of Serbia back in my home country. in 2012, I went on
to complete a residential 900 hour yoga teacher training at the Yoga Institute
Santacruz in Mumbai, India and spent a couple of months volunteering at health
camps and workshops that the Institute regularly held for the locals. Coming
back to England, I continued studying with Yogacampus and attending intensives
and immersions in London primarily focusing on yoga as therapy. After years of
studying and a dedicated daily practice I managed to restore my feet and rarely
had any back pain.

But then in 2014, shortly after my first child was born, I suffered a repetitive
strain injury of both wrists and a severe abdominal separation (diastasis recti)
with recurring back spasms that made me unable to continue my practice the way
it was. It was so incredibly frustrating to be getting re-injured over and over
again and have spasms every time I practised yoga, or even just carried my
child. Not moving couldn't be an option, but the way I used to move was hurting
me.

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and very
little research done about diastasis recti, especially about its connection with
back and pelvic pain. Abdominal separation is usually seen as an "aesthetic
problem" and most of the solutions available focused on patching the gap instead
of looking into what had caused it in the first place.

> I wanted to understand why injuries happen and how to avoid them in the first
> place.

Looking for answers I started obsessively learning different approaches to
movement and bodywork. Questioning, deconstructing and learning again from
various teachers across the fields of yoga as therapy, pilates, somatics, dance,
Structural Integration, myofascial release and massage.

In 2014 I discovered the work of American biomechanics scientist Katy Bowman
looking into forces of physics created by movement and how gravity, pressure and
friction affect tissues. I felt I finally found a missing piece I was looking
for. I wanted to learn how to think and see the body as a biomechanist and above
all, to understand what has contributed to my injury in the first place and see
if I could heal my abdominal separation without a surgery. In 2015 I started the
2-year certification with the Nutritious Movement Institute under Katy Bowman
and in October 2017 got qualified as a Nutritious Movementâ„¢ certified
Restorative Exercise Specialist.

These two years felt like peeling off layer by layer of all I knew about
movement, rebuilding and reconnecting everything again. I quickly gave up on the
surgery idea and instead of focussing on the separation itself I started
focussing on restoring the functionality of everything around it. I realised
that challenge for me was not to just move more but with more precision, getting
more parts of my body to actively participate in the movement. I started
focusing more on motor programming and proprioception in my movement practice,
isolating small movements and mastering them before jumping onto larger ones.
And gradually I restored a functional core and a body that is able to support me
in doing what I love.

Rebuilding confidence into what my body was able to do brought about a
transition to a much more movement-rich lifestyle. I gradually replaced all my
heeled shoes with minimal shoes, our family got rid of most of our furniture and
started spending a lot of our time outside, moving in nature. I started looking
at my environment differently, finding movement opportunities where there were
none: noticing all the trees for climbing on my walks, walking much more
barefoot and on varied surfaces, using the children playground time to hang,
climb and play with them instead of just standing around.

Exercise is not enough - I realised, we need MOVEMENT to thrive. Our bodies are
beautifully malleable and adapt to the way we use them.

> Not just exercise, but everything we do is an input.

You can create an environment that requires you to move more frequently and move
more parts of you as you go about your everyday life. Even making tiny changes
can make a big difference over time. Each little change creates a thousand
ripples.
