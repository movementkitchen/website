title: About
---

Hi there! I'm Ivana, a sports biomechanics scientist and coach with 13 years of experience working with movement. I am passionate about women's health and biological performance - read: how to make our bodies function at their best through different stages of our lives. I love researching, writing and geeking out about healthy pelvises, bellies and pressure inside them.   

Another half of my passion is longevity. I published research on [elite master endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/) who practically slowed down ageing with high levels of training. Yes, a good part of what we think of as 'ageing' is detraining and an adaptation to inactivity - so, totally avoidable!

Over the years, I've specialised in working with people with complex training needs, who struggle to break out of the pain and re-injury cycle and get stronger.

I was there once (or twice) myself. First time, as a desk-bound young professional in my 20s with chronic lower back pain and a half of my left foot completely numb. Second time, as a mum of two in my mid-30s with a weak, disconnected belly 2 clothing sizes up compared to the rest of my body, sneeze pee and my lower back in spasm every time I would open a heavy door.

I value evidence-based solutions and precise, focused training where everything has its ‘why’. My coaching style is grounded in empathy and non-violence – challenging the body with kindness.

### The rePower Method

I developed the rePower method through 13 years of my professional and personal journey with the gloal to seemlesly connect rehabilitation and strength and conditioning training.

Each rePower journey includes five stages:

1. *RELEASE* - learning to manage pain flare-ups
2. *RECONNECT* - restoring breath-core connection, learning new motor skills
3. *REBUILD* - building muscle, learning to manage pressure and stabilise joints in dynamic workouts
4. *REPOWER* - progressive overload, increasing pressure tolerance
5. *REINFORCE* - injury-proofing the core, training in vulnerable positions.

### Why Movement Kitchen?

I see kitchen as a nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen – with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I aim to recreate the safe and nourishing atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions too, offering a supportive space for you to get to know your body and get stronger on your own terms.

I value evidence-based solutions and precise, focused training where everything has its 'why', but my coaching style is grounded in empathy and non-violence – challenging the body with kindness.
