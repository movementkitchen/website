### About

Hi there! I’m Ivana, a sports and exercise scientist with a Master's degree in Biomechanics and over a decade of experience working with movement and rehabilitation. I have a special interest in mechanisms of injuries, ageing, and women's health and have published [research on ageing elite endurance runners](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol40/iss1/36/). I’m passionate about using my learning from athletes to improve quality of life of everyday mums. When I don't research or coach, you can usually find me singing on the 
bicycle or drawing in Walthamstow Marshes with my 7- and 9-year olds. 

### My Story

My movement journey has been paved by various injuries and an unstoppable urge
for learning in the process of overcoming them. I often felt my body was too
fragile to follow my pace of life.

In 2008 I left a career in corporate law with recurrent back and shoulder pain
and not being able to feel parts of my left foot. I found that yoga was helping
me, so, I went to study yoga. I completed my first 200-hour yoga teacher training in 2011 with the Yoga Federation of Serbia, back in my home country. In 2012 I continued my yoga studies at the Yoga Institute Santacruz in Mumbai, India, focussing on yoga therapy. I spent
three months living and studying full time (900 hours) at the Institute,
assisting and teaching at health camps and workshops that the Institute
regularly held for the locals. Back in the UK, I continued studying with
Yogacampus in London. After years of learning, teaching and a dedicated daily
practice I managed to fully restore my feet and rarely had any back pain. 

I specialised in teaching pregnancy and postpartum yoga classes, which allowed me to continue teaching throughout my both pregnancies and the births of my children in 2013 and 2015. But after my first baby was born, I suffered a severe abdominal separation - diastasis recti, recurring lower back spasms and De Quervain's tendinosis on both wrists. After the birth of my second child, my core was completely destroyed. It was incredibly frustrating to get re-injured and in pain every time I practised yoga or carried my baby. 

I found that there was so little support offered by the healthcare and little research done about diastasis recti, especially its connection with back and pelvic pain and disfunction. I couldn’t find a single physiotherapist who was able to help me. Abdominal separation was seen as a cosmetic problem and most of the solutions focused on patching the gap instead of looking into what had caused it. 

Looking for answers I started researching and learning across the fields of yoga, Pilates, corrective exercise, movement and manual therapies, exercise science, physiotherapy and women's health. Using my learning on my own body, I managed to gradually restore my core and eventually get stronger and more resilient than in my twenties.

In 2017, I completed a two-year training and qualified as a Personal Trainer – Restorative Exercise Specialist with Nutritious Movement Center Northwest, Sequim, WA, USA. Rather than teaching groups, I started focusing on one-to-one movement coaching to help people get out of the pattern of recurring injuries. Yoga with Ivana gradually became Movement Kitchen. 

Trying to understand mechanisms of injuries and how to prevent them brought me to a MSc in Biomechanics / Sport and Exercise Science at the University of Roehampton. I graduated in January 2021 with distinction. My dissertation on slowing down ageing with high levels of training in elite endurance runners was selected as the best in my field and I presented it to the next generation of the MSc in Sport Science students. In July 2022, my research was presented at the conference of the International Society of Biomechanics in Sport.

And my personal movement journey continues. At the moment, I am focused on using exercise and physical activity to support me through perimenopause. Trying to integrate more movement into my life, I've created a dynamic home office with both my desk and the stool being height-adjustable and mounted [a climbing frame right above my desk](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSwn5CbKN6b/) – so I can keep moving frequently while doing my research. Over the years, I've strengthened my feet, removed the supportive insoles from my shoes and replaced all the high-heeled shoes with wide and flexible minimal ones. Our family gradually got rid of most of our furniture. We started spending much more time outside, moving in nature. Longer I work with movement and the body more I realise, the true fitness progress is not determined by one-off accomplishments, but by blurring of the border between exercise and the rest of our lives.

### About Movement Kitchen

The name Movement Kitchen for me symbolises weaving movement into the everyday.
My studio really happens to be in our large open-plan kitchen. When I don't
teach here our living space is still an ever‐changing obstacle course with
balance boards, half domes and spiky balls lying around and me and the children
playfully climbing over them as I'm trying to cook dinner.

I aim to create the homely, intimate atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions
too. I work a lot with biomechanics and science of movement but in a relaxed and
informal way, guided by empathy and intuition. Instead of a lab my working space
is a kitchen, both literally and metaphorically.
