### My Story

I had never thought I could be the strongest in my life and the most confident in my body at the age of 45, as a mum of two.

I started suffering with back pain in my late 20s, as an overworked young corporate lawyer. I used to go to an osteopath every couple of weeks. Then in my mid-30s, after two close-up pregnancies and a difficult postpartum recovery, I ended up with a severe abdominal separation on top. More than a year after my second child was born, I still looked 6 months pregnant. I literally had to buy 2 sizes larger clothes to fit over my belly! And I couldn't open a heavy door or lift my children out of the bath without my back screaming at me.

I'm neurodivergent and I love learning and understanding how things work. So, when I have a problem, I throw a lot of learning at it ðŸ¤“

Solving a puzzle of my back pain and the weak, unresponsive belly, I spent over 13 yrs learning everything I could across the fields of movement, physiotherapy, sports and exercise science, and women's health. I was lucky to learn from and coach many incredible people along the way. I got fascinated with biological and athletic performance, which brought me to my second master's degree, in sports and exercise biomechanics.

Over the years, my approach crystallised into my signature method rePower, seamlessly connecting physiotherapy with strength & conditioning training.

### Each rePower journey includes three stages:

1. *RESTORE* - managing pain flare-ups, building core stability foundations
2. *REBUILD* - increasing muscle mass, core stability in dynamic workouts with added weights/resistance, progressive overload
3. *REINFORCE* - performance-based, sport-specific training, pushing your boundaries, injury-proofing the body

### Why Movement Kitchen?

I see kitchen as a nurturing environment, a space for creating, playing and experimenting. My studio really is a kitchen â€“ with large mirrors, a climbing frame and a variety of exercise props. I aim to recreate the safe and nourishing atmosphere of the kitchen in my sessions too, offering a supportive space for you to get to know your body and get stronger on your own terms.
