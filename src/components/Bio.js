        Iâ€™m Ivana, a movement coach, biomechanics nerd and mum to two energetic little people. Nearly a decade ago I left my career in corporate law and since then have been studying yoga as therapy, somatics, bodywork and teaching various modalities of movement. I am currently in the final year of my Restorative Exercise certification with Nutritious Movement studying under biomechanics scientist Katy Bowman. I am passionate about rediscovering the joy of play in movement and helping people feel stronger and more confident in their bodies.
