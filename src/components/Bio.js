          Hi, Iâ€™m Ivana, a movement coach, mum, mover and researcher, curently
          doing my MSc in Biomechanics. I'm passionate about improving human
          biological performance and quality of life through movement. Over the
          years, I've developed particular interest in women's musculoskeletal
          health, supporting women through different stages of their lives
          (pregnancy, postnatal, pre and post-menopause), empowering them to get
          stronger and more confident in their bodies.
        </p>
