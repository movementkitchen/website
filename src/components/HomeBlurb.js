          Kitchen is where the magic happens. A source of physical, mental and spiritual sustenance. Kitchen makes a home homely. It's a safe and intimate place for creation and exploration. A place of rekindling the joy of play, enjoying the process of making, getting the hands dirty. A place of connecting to our intuition, our inner wisdom, following the gut.

          I want you to experience our movement practice as a kitchen, not a lab. Equally about the process as it is about the result. Creating a safe and playful environment for inquiry and exploration through movement.

          I take biomechanics and the science of movement as a starting point in my work. I also work a lot with mindfulness and body awareness. Using somatic tools of proprioception and interoception we explore your experience of movement together. We tweak a parameter or two allowing the body to pick up, gradually growing into a more efficient alignment without force and straining. Playing along with the body we work towards finding a more sustainable way of moving, building towards a more balanced and robust strength in your day-to-day life.
